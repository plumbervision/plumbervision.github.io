<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes great.</p>
<p>Installing a new gas line in the kitchen will usually range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your home to gas, or if the present line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line costs consist of home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can develop sound. If your energy costs are rising, a brand-new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting tough water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its brand-new area and put there.</p>
