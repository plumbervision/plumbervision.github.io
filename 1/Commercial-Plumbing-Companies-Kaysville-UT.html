<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. Identify the size of the pipes in the house and around the house - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be adequate, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate circulation.</p>
<p>Installed under the sink, the garbage disposal is meant for chopping up smidgens of waste food. When switched on the motor impellers and spins-- also called lugs-- toss littles food against a mill ring.
