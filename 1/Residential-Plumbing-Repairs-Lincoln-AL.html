<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
