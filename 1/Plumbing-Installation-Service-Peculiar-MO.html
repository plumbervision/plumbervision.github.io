<p>The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Depending upon the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut down while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal interruption to your everyday regimen. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furnishings to protect them from dust and particles. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and then get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible intact.</p>
