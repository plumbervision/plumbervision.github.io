<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Glendora CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Discovering high water pressure at plumbing components in your house? Water pressure in the home is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is A LOT MORE economical than mold removal or changing flooring or drywall! So we recommend repairing or setting up water pressure regulators to secure your entire house.</p>
