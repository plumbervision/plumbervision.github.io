<h3>Sewer Pipe in Mount Carmel Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
