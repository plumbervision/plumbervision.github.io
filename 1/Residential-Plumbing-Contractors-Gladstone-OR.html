<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and obligation are extremely essential to constructing a track record for excellence. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet should be above the drain line coming out of the wall.

If however, you begin smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around your house, there could be a crack somewhere in your sewer line.</p>
