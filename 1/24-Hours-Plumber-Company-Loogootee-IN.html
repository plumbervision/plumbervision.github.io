<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this short article about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Due to the fact that they don't like the technology and not due to the fact that it doesn't work, will also say something doesn't work well merely. The piping process adds to the installation expenses if this heater is set up in a home with several bathrooms.</p>
