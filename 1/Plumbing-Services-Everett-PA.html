<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
