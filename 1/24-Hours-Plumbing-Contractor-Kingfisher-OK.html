Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
