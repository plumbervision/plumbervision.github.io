<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
