<p>Your home's drains and pipes silently eliminate countless gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even providing a second thought. However, when hair, food scraps, womanly health products, toys, and other foreign objects make their method into your drains, they can lead to major problems. While often it's apparent you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is entirely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for example), it can often be more difficult to tell if you have a problem on your hands.</p>

Harmed sewer lines can lead to restrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and expensive repairs.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner package. The total repair bill may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the new heater.</p>
