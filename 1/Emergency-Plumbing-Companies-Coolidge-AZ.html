<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of.

That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
