<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it might wreak unwanted problems on your home. A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
