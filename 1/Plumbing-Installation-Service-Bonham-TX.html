When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
