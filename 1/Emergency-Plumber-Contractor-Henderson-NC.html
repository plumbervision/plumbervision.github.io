<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
