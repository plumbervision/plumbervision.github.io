<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you have actually discovered the journey lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method.

<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were great. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess. They, as with each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and very knowledgeable. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either small or large task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of solidity ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
