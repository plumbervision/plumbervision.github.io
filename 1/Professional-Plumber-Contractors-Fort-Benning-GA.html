The other difference between constant feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals only crush the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not at one time like a constant feed waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine beneath to be sure there aren't any leakages. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however many homes built between the 1930s - 1980s still have them.
