Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
