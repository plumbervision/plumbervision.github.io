<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Dequincy LA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The highly toxic insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company staff member had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your home into the water system.</p>
