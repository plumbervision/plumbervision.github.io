Find out more about the advantages of repiping your house by calling our Knoxville repiping plumbers at (865) 238-2280 today. For around $40, you might choose to purchase a push button set that permits a sink-top switch button to run your disposal.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks.
