<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that backflow prevention is needed when required, along with inspection of the device to make certain it's working appropriately.
