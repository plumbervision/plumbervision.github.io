<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
