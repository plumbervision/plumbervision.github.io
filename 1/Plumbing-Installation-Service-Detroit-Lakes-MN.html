Without practical draining, excessive pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to expensive water damage.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, utilizing wire nuts.

Plumbing plans are not needed for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
