<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Tucker GA</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
