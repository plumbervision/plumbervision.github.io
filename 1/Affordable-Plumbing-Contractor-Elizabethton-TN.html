If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater really quickly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature to see if firmness had an influence on detergent savings. The research study consisted of tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to assessing shooting and spotting. Researchers discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>
