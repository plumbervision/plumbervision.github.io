<p>If you want it to work well for years to come, your garbage disposal installation needs to be brought out by a professional plumber. It is a reasonably easy device that draws food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are small enough, they pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of. It generally takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side if you have a duel drain setup.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers should be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Location a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only viable choice.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time related. If whatever is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
