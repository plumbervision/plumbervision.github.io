<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Leakages- Do not pay for warm water you're not delighting in! Our plumbers will locate any leaks and properly seal them. 4 - The regeneration solution (CO2-enriched water) streams from the regrowth storage tank (4) to the exchanger filter.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
