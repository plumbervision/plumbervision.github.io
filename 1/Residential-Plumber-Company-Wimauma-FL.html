<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select should be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary obstructions even more down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of impurities and will need to be replaced. (This need to not hold true if the resin is occasionally regenerated and kept.) Consult your water softener dealer for information on resin replacement.</p>
