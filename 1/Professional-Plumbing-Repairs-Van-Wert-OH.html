If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, however opportunities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
