<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be identified to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
