<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated clinical procedure, however easy to correct. It uses salt to get rid of minerals and odors found in difficult water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that bring in and connect sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
