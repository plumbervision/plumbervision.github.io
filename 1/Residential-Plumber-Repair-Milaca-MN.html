<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
