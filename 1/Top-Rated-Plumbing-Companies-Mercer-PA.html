When it's time for replacement, here's how to assess your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the house. Typically, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
