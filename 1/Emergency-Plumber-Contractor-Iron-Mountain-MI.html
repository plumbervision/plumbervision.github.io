<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Iron Mountain MI</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut off, properly situated test dicks, and the necessary components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each element can further be broken down into its parts. For example a first check is a component. A part can even more be broken down into its specific parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make parts, and parts are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
