<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
