<p>If you're dealing with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless home appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener. Tough water is not an issue that will disappear on its own and the costs sustained by difficult water will only continue to intensify.
