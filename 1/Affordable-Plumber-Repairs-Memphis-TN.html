I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier.

Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
