<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
