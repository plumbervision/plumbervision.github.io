Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow.
