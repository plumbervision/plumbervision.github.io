<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on properties change that may require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your business, they can cause monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your service totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little workplace the problems brought on by even small drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
<p>Contact us for a quote. Our certified and trained plumbers will offer you with a sincere, in advance rate on the cost to install a toilet or repair ($ 29 or FREE if you choose us to repair or replace your toilet).
