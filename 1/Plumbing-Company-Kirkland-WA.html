<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>

Local code will define what items in your area needs which particular type of backflow prevention device.
