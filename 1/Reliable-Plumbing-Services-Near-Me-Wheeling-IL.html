<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Wheeling IL 60090</h3>
<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is happy to use Bio-Clean items for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and extremely effective at removing grime, waste, and organic product that so typically blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and only partially repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and gnaw at it, producing safe by-products of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
