<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Carl Junction MO</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair.

A component can even more be broken down into its private parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make parts, and elements are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
