<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
