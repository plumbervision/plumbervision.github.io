<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
