<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
