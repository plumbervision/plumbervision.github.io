<p>Leaks are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
