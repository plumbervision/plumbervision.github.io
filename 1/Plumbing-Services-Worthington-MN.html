If your plumber requires a license to repair the gas leak, which they'll most likely need to perform in the Atlanta city area, the costs to pull the license will contribute to your repair cost. Although the life expectancy of your home's pipes differs due to a plethora of elements (including wear and tear and whether you reside in a cold-weather environment), an excellent guideline is to replace them if they are 50-years-old or older.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
