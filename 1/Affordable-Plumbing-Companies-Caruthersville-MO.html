<p>Think about all the locations water flows in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional assessment ought to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines need to be covered.

Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
