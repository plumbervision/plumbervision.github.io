We now have actually cleaned and checked the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the elements to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the right location.
