<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In homes with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home. Even if the issue comes from with the municipal system, it's still clever to generate the specialists to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
