<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using devices from poor efficiency and early failure. Some tough water problems are very visible, like sprayers and dispensers becoming clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater components and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Invisible or noticeable, these problems have genuine expenses associated with them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can frustrate your customers.
