<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is very important to the safety of your patrons and workers. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all.

Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
