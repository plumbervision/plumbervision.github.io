<h3>Septic System Installation in Lindsay California</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of defense for the public water system system.</p>

For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
