It's time to call in a professional if your disposal starts making loud noises or doesn't operate at all. Never put yourself at risk of injury by putting your hand in the drain. We have the training and tools to repair or replace the disposal the right way. We'll diagnose the issue and rapidly fix it so you can have a working disposal before your next meal.</p>
