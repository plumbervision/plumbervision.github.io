Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water.

Adequate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>

This method works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as sinks and showers. Backflow is the circulation of water in the wrong direction from a client's water system into the public water supply. Backflow might be brought on by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
