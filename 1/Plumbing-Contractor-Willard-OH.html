<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and depends on a good balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers end up being disappointing, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the home and the variety of restrooms and plumbing components-- utility room, damp bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last expenses.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
