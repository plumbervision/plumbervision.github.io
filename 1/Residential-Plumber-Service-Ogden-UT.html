<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow.
