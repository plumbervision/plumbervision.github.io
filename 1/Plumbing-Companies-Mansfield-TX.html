Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health risk and often go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and cause separations. Our plumbers frequently perform a dye test to identify the source due to the fact that the source of leaking water can be difficult to find.
