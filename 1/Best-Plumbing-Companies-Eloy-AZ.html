<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be provided.</p>
