<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a brand-new hot water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>The cost of installation depends upon a variety of variables, including the kind of hot water heater and your present plumbing setup.
