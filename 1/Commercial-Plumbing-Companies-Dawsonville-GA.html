<p>All toilets are not created equal and buying the incorrect toilet can cost you a lot more in the long run than the cost of the toilet in the very first location.

<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
