<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Fairmont WV</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
