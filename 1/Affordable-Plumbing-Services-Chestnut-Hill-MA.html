<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several kinds of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from rust and may position toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your house.
