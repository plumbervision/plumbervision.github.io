Roll plumber's putty between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and wrap it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening. Press the kitchen sink strainer securely down into the putty, add the rubber gasket, friction ring and locknut under the sink, and retighten the locknut.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines.
