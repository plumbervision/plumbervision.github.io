<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Glastonbury CT</h3>
<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to pass through. Because of the tight space, the pipes often make strange gurgling sounds as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>A plumbing inspection is an organized procedure of assessing the crucial areas of the plumbing system of a residential or commercial property. It is performed by certified plumbers to prevent the risk of pipe deterioration, clogs, leaks, and burst tubes that can trigger flooding and residential or commercial property damage.
