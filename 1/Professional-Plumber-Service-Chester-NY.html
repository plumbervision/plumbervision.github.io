Old-fashioned water softeners are notorious for triggering a spike in the price of your monthly energy bills. Lots of require big amounts of water and can be pricey for the electricity costs, but the NuvoH2O system is various. Our saltless H2O conditioning system uses up to 4x less water than others and requires no electricity.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
