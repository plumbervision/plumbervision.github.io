SACr physically removes temporary hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant restrictions of current softening technologies.</p>

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
