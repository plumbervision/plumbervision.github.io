Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it.

As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another visit.
