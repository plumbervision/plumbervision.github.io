The repair of a backflow preventer needs the professional to have the needed knowledge of how to detect the problem and bring back the backflow prevention assembly to its initial factory specs.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
