<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water.
