<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

<p>For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.
