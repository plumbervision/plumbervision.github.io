<p>Sinkholes do not just take place in your lawn, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your home's structure, the very best you can hope for is to find out quickly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out underneath your house, a sinkhole will cause the structure to shift and develop cracks. In this case, you'll need expert plumbers along with structure repair professionals.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten the drain locknut. Last but not least, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
