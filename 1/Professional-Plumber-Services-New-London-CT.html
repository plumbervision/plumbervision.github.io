<p>Water heater failures cause countless dollars in water damages every year. Bear in mind that when picking your new commercial hot water heater, you get what you spend for.

<p>Examining the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning.
