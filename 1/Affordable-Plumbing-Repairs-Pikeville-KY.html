<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather protection.
