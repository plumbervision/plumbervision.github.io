However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
