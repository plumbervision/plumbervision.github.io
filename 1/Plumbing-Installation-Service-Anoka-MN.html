<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it does not necessarily indicate they need to be changed. Well-kept pipes may last longer, and poorly maintained ones or those in areas with tough water (indicating it has high mineral material), might fail earlier, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>A lot of need for plumbers will originate from brand-new building and the need to repair and keep plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to developing codes that need the use of fire suppression systems.

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain. Many drains are connected to the sink by a large nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
