Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and just partly fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and eat away at it, producing harmless by-products of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
