<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized.
