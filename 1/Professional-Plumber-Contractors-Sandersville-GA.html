Many people discard food waste in the trash, which suggests more garbage to enter garbage dumps or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's often stinky and commonly uses plastic bags to carry the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in garbage dumps instead of breaking down.</p>

At first, these small deposits are harmless, but over time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
