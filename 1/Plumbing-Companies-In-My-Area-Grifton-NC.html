<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Grifton NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
