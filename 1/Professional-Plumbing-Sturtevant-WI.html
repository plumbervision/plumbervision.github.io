With over 40 years of plumbing experience under our belt, there isn't much that we haven't seen which we do not understand how to repair or replace correctly.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is incredibly difficult, all the incoming water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry hookups probably must be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In many cases, you may want to soften the hot water just. Step the water use at the designated hookups for each person in the household or utilize the following table as a guide.</p>
