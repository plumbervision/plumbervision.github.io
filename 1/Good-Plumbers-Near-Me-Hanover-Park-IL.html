<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
