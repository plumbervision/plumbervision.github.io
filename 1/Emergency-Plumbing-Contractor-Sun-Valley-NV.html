Other than within Shoreline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County).

<p>These branching circulation pipelines form loops and networks including water mains and supply pipelines. Water mains vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in size. The pipelines provide water for entire communities along with big commercial, industrial and residential complexes. Depending on the flow capability, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
