For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your house to gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line expenses include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>

When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
