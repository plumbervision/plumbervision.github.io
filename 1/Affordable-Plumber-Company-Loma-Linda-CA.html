Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
