<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Denton TX 76210</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>If you're dealing with a reliable plumber in Utah, they will typically guarantee their deal with a warranty. That means if something goes wrong later, you will have someone who can fix it without any included costs. The alternative diy (DIY) method offers no such assurances, and in a lot of cases unless you know a lot about plumbing, there's a pretty significant danger that you may do more damage. When that happens, you will most likely need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your errors, and opportunities are they will cost more and be harder than if you had simply called a professional in the very first place.</p>
