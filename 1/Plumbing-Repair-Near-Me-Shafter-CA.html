<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
