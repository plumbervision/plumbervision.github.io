<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Bardstown</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
