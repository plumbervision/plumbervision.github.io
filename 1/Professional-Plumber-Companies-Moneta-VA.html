<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Moneta VA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in new homes, but many homes built between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when found and changed with another pipe product.</p>
