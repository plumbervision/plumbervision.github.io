When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
