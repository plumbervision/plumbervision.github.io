<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work. Your house's main rain gutter system collects rainwater from the roofing line and manages its path down the house to ground; but the water might still puddle next to the foundation. That's where underground rain gutter drains are practical. They attach to the downspouts on your home and relocation water far from the structure underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process utilized to clear particles from the side gutter pipes on your home.</p>
