These devices are often integrated into single items to increase their efficiency, such as double check valve assemblies (consisting of two successive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (2 inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located between them to dispose out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
