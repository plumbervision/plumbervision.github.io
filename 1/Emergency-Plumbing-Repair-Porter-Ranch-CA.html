Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
