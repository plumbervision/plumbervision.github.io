<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>These are all signs that your unit need to be inspected by a plumber. We don't suggest attempting to repair this specific device by yourself, since it does present a security hazard, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to grind and chop waste. Because these chemicals will only damage the device even more, you should also prevent using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit.
