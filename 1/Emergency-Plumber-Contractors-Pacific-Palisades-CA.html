<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
