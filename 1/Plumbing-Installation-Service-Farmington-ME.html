<h3>Water Heater Repair Services at Farmington ME 04938</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, just like each person we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and really knowledgeable. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either big or small job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers might be required on a number of other areas in a home or services either to isolated the residential or commercial property from the public water system or to obstruct internal backflows in a building's plumbing system. Examples are medical offices, dining establishments and convenience stores. Tankless water heaters are likewise called as needed water heaters. These systems make sense for property owners for several reasons. They save energy, conserve cash, and provide hot water to you instantly. In getaway or 2nd houses they can be specifically preferable.</p>
