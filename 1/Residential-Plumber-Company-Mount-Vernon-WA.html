<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component.

Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
