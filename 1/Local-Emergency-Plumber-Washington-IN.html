<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Washington IN 47501</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
