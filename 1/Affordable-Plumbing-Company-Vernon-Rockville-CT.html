<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Examining the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect.

When turned off, no faucet in the house ought to have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. If whatever is working properly, you are off to a good start.</p>
