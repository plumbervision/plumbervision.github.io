<p>That said, you don't always need to drain tens of thousands of dollars on fixing your house's pipe or sewer lines. With innovative trenchless technologies, digging, and the restorative landscaping that follows, is mostly avoided. Repairs are suitable for small leakages, particularly if you have plumbing that was installed in just the previous 10 years. A repipe is more involved than repairing a clogged toilet or perhaps fixing a single pipe. With a repipe, you will be changing your entire water supply system in your home.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
