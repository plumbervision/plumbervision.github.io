<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The total repair costs may be in the $300 range.

That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
