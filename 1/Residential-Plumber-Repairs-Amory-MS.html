<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in locations where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.
