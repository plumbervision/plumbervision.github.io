<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be removed. Backflow assemblies are needed to be installed on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law also requires backflow assemblies in commercial establishments such as mortuaries and health centers, as well as commercial facilities.</p>
<p>The majority of backflow preventers are designed to allow the elements to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed for the most part. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
