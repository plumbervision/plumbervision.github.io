<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any number of aspects which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place.

If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the expansion occurring when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and start leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
