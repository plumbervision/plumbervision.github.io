<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten the drain locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
