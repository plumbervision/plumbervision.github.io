<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be offered.</p>

During hours of low need, the water circulation can be utilized to refill storage tanks, towers and cisterns, which then offer water for emergency usage and durations when demand surpasses the baseline pumping rate.

The thermal growth needs to get away, thus the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure.

The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
