<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Cottage Grove MN</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Normally, minerals arrive because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers difficult water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
