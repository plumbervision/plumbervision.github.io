<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
