<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
