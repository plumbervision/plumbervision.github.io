<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the within. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
