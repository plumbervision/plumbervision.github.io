<p>Backflow is bad news.

<h3>Drain Service in Lexington South Carolina</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and private on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention techniques.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
