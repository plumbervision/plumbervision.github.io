It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
