<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
