<p>The anode rod in your water heater is designed to attract corrosion-causing elements in the water, assisting to avoid the steel tank from wearing away. The best method to prevent drain blockages is to see what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see stains, discoloration, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away.
