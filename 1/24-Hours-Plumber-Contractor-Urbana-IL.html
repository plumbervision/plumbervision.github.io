<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention options, however they also supply the least amount of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc rises and seals off the air inlet.</p>
