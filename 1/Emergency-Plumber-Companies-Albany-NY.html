<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your house, then that usually means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
