New gas line costs include appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might cause incorrect data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to severe pressure spikes that could harm components.
