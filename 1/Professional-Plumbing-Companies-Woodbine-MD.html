Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Many large cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
