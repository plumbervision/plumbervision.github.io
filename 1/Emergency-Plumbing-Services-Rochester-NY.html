<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
