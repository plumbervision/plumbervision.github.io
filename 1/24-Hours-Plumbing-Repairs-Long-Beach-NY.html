<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
