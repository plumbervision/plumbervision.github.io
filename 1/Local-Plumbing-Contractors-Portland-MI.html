<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
