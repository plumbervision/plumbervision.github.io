<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Wrightsville PA 17368</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
