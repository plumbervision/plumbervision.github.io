<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Georgetown SC</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
