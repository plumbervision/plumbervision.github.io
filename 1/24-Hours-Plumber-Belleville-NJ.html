<p>Doctor Fix-It is Denver's source for a professional toilet repair or replacement service. The whole house has polybutylene plumbing. This is a kind of plastic resin that was extensively used by builders for houses integrated in the 1970s through the 1990s. The problem with this type of plastic piping is it can end up being fragile and break quickly, particularly if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>We concentrate on entire house re-pipes, brand-new plumbing installations, and mainline water service replacement. Whether you need help with a minor repair, a remodel or a re-pipe, you can make sure that the work will be finished the first time accurately. Low water pressure could be due to a multitude of elements, however the most common reasons are sediment accumulation and corrosion, which both obstruct water from passing through the whole pipe and put unwanted pressure on particular areas of pipe.</p>
<p>Our blocked drain Los Angeles solutions are tailored to your specific problem. Whether the clog is in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower drains, we can clear it. The location of the drain is necessary because it helps our plumbers to understand the type of clog they might be dealing with.
