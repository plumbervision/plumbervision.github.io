The LADBS application should be submitted and paid for a minimum of two (2) organisation days prior to the date of the event, AND, after you have obtained all other required approvals or clearances from all other agencies. Garbage disposals can be made from either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is cheaper but more susceptible to leaking and deterioration. Stainless-steel blades are also more durable. Individuals with a septic tank will need to contact the septic system installer or maker to discover which garbage disposal models are compatible with their system.</p>
