<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. Figure out the size of the pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to determine the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in size to offer appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
