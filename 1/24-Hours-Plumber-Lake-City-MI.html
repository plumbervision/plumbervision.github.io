<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
