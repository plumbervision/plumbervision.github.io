<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive option.</p>
<p>List prices for home water softeners might range from approximately $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and type of softener.
