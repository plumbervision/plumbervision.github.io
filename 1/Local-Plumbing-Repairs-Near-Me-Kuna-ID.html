<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate one of the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
