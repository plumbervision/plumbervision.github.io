<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Waterford WI</h3>
<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be supplied.</p>

An extermination company staff member had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water supply.</p>
