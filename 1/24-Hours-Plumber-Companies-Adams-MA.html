<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Adams MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
