<p>Every factory and every household utilizes water, and none of it is pure. A range of pipe products are utilized for entire house repiping, including PEX and copper pipe.

<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year.
