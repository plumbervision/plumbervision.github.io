<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were enabled to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Typically, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
