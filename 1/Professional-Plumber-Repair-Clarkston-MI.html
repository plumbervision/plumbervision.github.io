This is a kind of plastic resin that was extensively used by home builders for homes built in the 1970s through the 1990s. The issue with this type of plastic piping is it can end up being brittle and break easily, especially if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health threat if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be shown on building plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and after that annually.</p>
