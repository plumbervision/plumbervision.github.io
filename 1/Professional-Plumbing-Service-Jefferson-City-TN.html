For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.
