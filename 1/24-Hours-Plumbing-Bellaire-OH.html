<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
