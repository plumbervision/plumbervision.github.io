<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furnishings to secure them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will just eliminate as much building material as needed to reach, separate, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling listed below it. If you wish, you can arrange to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>
