<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
