<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be difficult to spot and can also harm your residential or commercial property. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are likewise a health danger and frequently go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and cause separations. Our plumbers frequently perform a dye test to identify the source since the source of leaking water can be difficult to find. Typically, pipes or water service lines are replaced, just to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly dirty or discolored and typically gets incorrect for a water supply line leak.</p>
