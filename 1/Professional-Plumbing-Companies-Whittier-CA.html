<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
