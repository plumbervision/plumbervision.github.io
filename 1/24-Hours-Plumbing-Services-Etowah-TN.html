It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
