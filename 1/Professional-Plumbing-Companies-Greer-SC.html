<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Greer SC</h3>
<p>A lot of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
