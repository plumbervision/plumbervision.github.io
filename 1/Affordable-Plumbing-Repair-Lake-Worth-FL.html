<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
