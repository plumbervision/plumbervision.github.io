<p>High water pressure also results in thermal expansion in water heaters which can cause possible water damage if the water heater leaks or burst. The more of these components you have, the more expensive the task will be. Because the plumber has to replace the secondary drain and incoming lines (see image below) for each plumbing fixture, that's. Replacing the pipes for lots of plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, wipe the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the pictures to make certain the connections are tight.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>This article aims to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a couple of complicated facts that typically lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally destructive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>The cost of installation depends on a variety of variables, including the type of hot water heater and your present plumbing configuration. For the most accurate estimate, we recommend submitting an estimate demand form quote demand type At Mr. Rooter, we believe in up-front, flat-rate prices.
