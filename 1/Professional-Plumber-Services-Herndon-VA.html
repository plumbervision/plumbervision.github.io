<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by aligning it if you don't have a plumber's snake.
