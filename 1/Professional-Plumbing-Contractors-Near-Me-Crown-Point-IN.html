But if the leak issues are frequent and from time to time some or the other corner of your home has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to check the entire piping system to perform home repiping.

<p>When you've found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
