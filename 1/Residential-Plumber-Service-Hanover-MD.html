In many cases, removal will just add an extra $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however in many cases the expenses might be greater if additional pipes should also be changed.</p>
<p>Double Inspect Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Double Examine Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a stripped down Check Valve without shut off valves and test cocks.

<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage just for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are thought about a health hazard if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be shown on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and after that annually.</p>
