<p>Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant gotten here throughout the designated time period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be used in the future.

<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be corrected quickly if the obstruction is shallow and simple. For the majority of obstructions you'll simply need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this doesn't fix the issue then you might also have to contact a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
