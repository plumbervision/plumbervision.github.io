Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are likewise a health risk and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and cause separations.

<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.
