At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
