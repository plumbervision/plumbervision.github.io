Some tough water problems are really noticeable, like sprayers and dispensers becoming clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Visible or undetectable, these problems have actually genuine expenses related to them. Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can annoy your customers.

<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines.
