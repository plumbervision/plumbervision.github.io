<p>Difficult water reduces the lifespan of many major appliances and systems in your home due to the quantity of limescale and sediment accumulation that takes place. Limescale on pipes can trigger deterioration and blockages, which not only reduces the lifespan of the pipes but puts you in a position where you may have to pay for a costly repair.
