<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Belmont MI</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service might look like a waste of cash. Why purchase professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners may be an inexpensive option, the harsh active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, over time, producing weak points in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
