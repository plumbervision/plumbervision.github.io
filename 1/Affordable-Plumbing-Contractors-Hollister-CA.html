<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some softeners work on electrical power, but some more current water softeners use waterpower.

Good to know: In chemistry, the reaction of salt polycarboxylate with hard water ions is referred to as chelation and salt polycarboxylate is, for that reason, a chelating agent In short, this implies sodium polycarboxylate uses 100% of its bonds to difficult water ions - normally chemical bonding takes 50% from each particle.</p>

This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
