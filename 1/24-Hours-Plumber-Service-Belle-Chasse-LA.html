Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
