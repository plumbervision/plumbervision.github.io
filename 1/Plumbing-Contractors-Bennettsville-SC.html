<p>Upon earning a high school diploma or GED, potential plumbing contractors need to start a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most common way for plumbers to learn the abilities required to end up being successful in the trade. A lot of apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor organizations. Programs normally last four to 5 years and require apprentices to complete a particular variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
