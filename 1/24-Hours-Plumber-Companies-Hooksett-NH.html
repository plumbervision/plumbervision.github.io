<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these issues can be credited to normal wear and tear or improper installation, often your garbage disposal ends up being damaged by items that should not be run through it.</p>
