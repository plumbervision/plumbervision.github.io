<p>As soon as you've found the trip lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and changed with brand-new rubber parts.
