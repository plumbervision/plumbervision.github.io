<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
