<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters should be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only feasible alternative.</p>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be fixed quickly if the obstruction is basic and shallow. For most obstructions you'll just need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, however if this does not resolve the issue then you might also have to contact a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
