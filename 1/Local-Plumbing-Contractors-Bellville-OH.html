We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing major and regular leaks.

<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leakages.

Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer utilized in brand-new homes, but many homes constructed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when found and replaced with another pipe material.</p>
