<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Bangor ME</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
