When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
