<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Bay Shore NY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Bay Shore NY 11706</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
