<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
