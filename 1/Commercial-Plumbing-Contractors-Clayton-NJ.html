<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
