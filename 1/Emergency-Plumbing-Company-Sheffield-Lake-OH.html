<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
