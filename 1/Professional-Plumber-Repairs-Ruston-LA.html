This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
