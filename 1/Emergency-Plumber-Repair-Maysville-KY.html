<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet at Maysville KY 41056</h3>

When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
