<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
