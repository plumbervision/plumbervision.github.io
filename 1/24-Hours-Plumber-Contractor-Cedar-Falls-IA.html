<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Cedar Falls IA 50613</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
