<p>To link a power cable to the brand-new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts.

It's likely that the brand-new unit will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain. Many drains are connected to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
