<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
