<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Los Lunas NM</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
