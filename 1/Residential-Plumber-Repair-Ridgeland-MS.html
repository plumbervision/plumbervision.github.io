<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
