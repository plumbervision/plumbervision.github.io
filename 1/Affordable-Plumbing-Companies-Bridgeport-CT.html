<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more susceptible and breakable to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Particular pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and stress as a result of temperature change and ice development. And these differences determine the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
