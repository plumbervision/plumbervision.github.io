<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is delicate to water pressure and counts on a good balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers become disappointing, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair.

The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final expenses.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
