Sam Blanc and an early Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine. Also, if you smell sulfur or rotten eggs, hear a hissing sound near a gas line, see a white cloud near a gas line, call the gas company's emergency number for immediate service. Turn the gas off immediately at the shut-off valve and leave the house until it's fixed.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and check connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work.

<p>The simplest service may appear to be merely overlooking the issue or using a do it yourself chemical solution. However, this is a momentary fix and might trigger more damage.
