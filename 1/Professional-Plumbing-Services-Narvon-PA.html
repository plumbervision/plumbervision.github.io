<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

From washing your face, brushing your teeth, and showering, to doing kitchen chores like washing meals, warm water is a necessity.
