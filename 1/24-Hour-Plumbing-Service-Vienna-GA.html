The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health threat or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
