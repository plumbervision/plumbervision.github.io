<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each component.
