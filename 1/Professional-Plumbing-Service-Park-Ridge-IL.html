<p>Our plumber groups intend to keep your home and work places effective, comfortable and functional. Another indication your disposal requires replacement would be odd noises. If your disposal is frequently making sounds that are unusual for the machine, it might be in need of major repairs or it could be nearing completion of its lifespan. Frequent obstructions, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could show a problem with the disposal.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
