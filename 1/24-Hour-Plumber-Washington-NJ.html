<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey option.</p>
