<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furnishings to protect them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just remove as much building material as essential to reach, remove, and remove the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling listed below it. If you want, you can arrange to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>
