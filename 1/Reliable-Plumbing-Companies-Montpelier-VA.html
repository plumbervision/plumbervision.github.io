<p>Leakages are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
