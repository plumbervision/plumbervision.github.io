The repair of a backflow preventer requires the specialist to have the essential understanding of how to diagnose the problem and restore the backflow prevention assembly to its original factory specifications. Even if the specialist has the necessary background, some actions need to be taken first before starting the actual repair.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
