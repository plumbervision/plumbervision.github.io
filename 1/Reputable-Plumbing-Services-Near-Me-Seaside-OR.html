<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and break or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
