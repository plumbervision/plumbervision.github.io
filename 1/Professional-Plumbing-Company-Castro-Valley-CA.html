Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
