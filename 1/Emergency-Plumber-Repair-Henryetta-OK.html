The next typical problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common issue is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is specifically true if you have unattended hard water, which consists of extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the product in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair.
