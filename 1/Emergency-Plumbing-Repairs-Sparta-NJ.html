Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace changes to developing codes that require using fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal attached to the sink currently, it's most likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. The majority of drains are attached to the sink by a large nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
