<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
