Waste disposal unit can be made of either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is less expensive however more vulnerable to leaking and corrosion. Stainless-steel blades are also more resilient. People with a septic tank will need to consult the septic tank installer or maker to discover which waste disposal unit models are compatible with their system.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is.

So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe.
