A Backflow Prevention Device is used to secure portable water materials from contamination or contamination due to backflow. In water supply systems, water is normally preserved at a considerable pressure to enable water to flow.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent.

This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
