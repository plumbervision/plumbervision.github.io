<p>Safeguard your house from leakages. There are a number of things that you should think about to help you decide when you need a water heater replacement. A good basic general rule is that when your current hot water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you ought to begin getting ready for a replacement. At this age, you will understand that it is nearing the end of its effectiveness so this is a great time to start taking a look at your replacement options. When the day comes that it stops working, this way you won't have a surprise cost on your hands.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. You may need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing info. Inspect the list of state licensing companies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
