<p>Is your drain clogged with debris, hair, or toilet paper? After years of usage, drains can collect damaging accumulation. This accumulation obstructs water flow, eventually backing up your drains up until they are unusable. Generally, all the pipes need is a good scrubbing. We can achieve this through a variety of techniques such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
