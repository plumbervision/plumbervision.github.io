<h3>Leaking Pipes Repair in Elkridge Maryland</h2>
<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as described below. Both will produce an excellent seal (though the gasket may result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
