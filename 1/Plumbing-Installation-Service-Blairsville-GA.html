<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
