<p>As soon as a large sufficient source of water has actually been identified and assessed, the 3rd significant element of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. A lot of large cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
