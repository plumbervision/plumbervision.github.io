<p>Changing your flapper may need somewhat different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly essential, sometimes the plumber might have to update or repair wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This typically costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot light may need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be stained or degraded if the gas line is harmed. Contact our specialists to identify the level of the problem.</p>
