<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Pueblo CO</h3>
<p>Many houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
