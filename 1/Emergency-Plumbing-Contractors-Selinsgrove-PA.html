<p>These are all indications that your system ought to be inspected by a plumber. We do not advise attempting to repair this particular home appliance by yourself, since it does provide a safety risk, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and slice waste. You must likewise avoid utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit since these chemicals will only damage the appliance even more.</p>
<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are saying.
