<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections in between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches.

The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.
