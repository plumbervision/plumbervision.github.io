<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The water heater tank must have some room to represent the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to get away, hence the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force exerted by the expansion occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
