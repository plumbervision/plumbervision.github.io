<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, but they also offer the least quantity of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, likewise called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
