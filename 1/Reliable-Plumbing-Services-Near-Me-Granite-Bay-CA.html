<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
