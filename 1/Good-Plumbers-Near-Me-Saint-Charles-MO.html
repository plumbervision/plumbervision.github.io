They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Saint Charles MO</h3>

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable service, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
