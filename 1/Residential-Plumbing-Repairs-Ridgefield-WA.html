<p>When you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank.

Remember that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
