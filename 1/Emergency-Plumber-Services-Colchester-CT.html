<p>Rather of drudging big trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter service technicians will drill simply a few holes to see where the sewer line problem is and resolve it quickly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal choice for your house or organisation.

If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.
