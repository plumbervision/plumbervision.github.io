<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they deteriorate over years.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from deterioration and may put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home.
