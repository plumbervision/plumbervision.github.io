<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard.

Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company employee had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water supply.</p>

<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any number of aspects which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and start leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
