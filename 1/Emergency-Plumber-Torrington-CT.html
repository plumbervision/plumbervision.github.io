<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Torrington CT</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Burst Pipe Hydraulic Replacement - Like pipe relining, this also does not involve digging and changing.
