<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In King NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
