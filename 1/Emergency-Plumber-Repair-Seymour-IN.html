Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
