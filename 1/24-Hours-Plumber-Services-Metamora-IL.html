However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and blended with water.
