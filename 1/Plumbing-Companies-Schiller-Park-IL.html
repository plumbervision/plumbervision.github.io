Keep an eye out for several clogged drains in your house, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water spots on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
