<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide.

If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
