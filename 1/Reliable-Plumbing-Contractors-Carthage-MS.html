<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Carthage MS 39051?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, bathtub, or sink) can be fixed easily if the clog is shallow and basic. For many obstructions you'll simply need a plunger, and often some chemicals, however if this does not fix the issue then you might also need to contact a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
