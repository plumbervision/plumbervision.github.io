<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured.

That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

Constant feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.
