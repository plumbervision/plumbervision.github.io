<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
