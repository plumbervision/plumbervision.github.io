<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
