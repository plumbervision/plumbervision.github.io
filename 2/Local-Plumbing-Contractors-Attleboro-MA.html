<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
