Customers ought to also sign up the disposal to take advantage of the producer guarantee period.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is necessary that just initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.
