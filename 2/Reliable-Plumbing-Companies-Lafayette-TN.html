Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
