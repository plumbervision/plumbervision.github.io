<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
