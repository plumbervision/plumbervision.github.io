<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Beverly Hills CA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
