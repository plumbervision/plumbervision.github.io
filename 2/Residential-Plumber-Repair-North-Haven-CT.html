<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in North Haven CT 06473</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
