<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank.

Each of our service technicians cleans up countless drains in a year, more than the typical plumber cleans up in a lifetime.

<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>As holds true with any plumbing appliance or water treatment system, your water softener must be expertly set up and serviced. This is the only way to guarantee that your system can manage the demand of your household, which it will in fact get the job done effectively. Maintenance needs are minimal, but it does pay to have the system inspected for proper operation routinely.</p>
