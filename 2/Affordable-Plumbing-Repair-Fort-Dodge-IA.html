<p>Please let EBMUD know of any circumstance that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that may require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your organisation, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your service totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little workplace the issues caused by even small drain problems can trigger significant problems.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control workplace. The contractor must possess a valid, current plumbing license, existing insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently adjusted test set. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
