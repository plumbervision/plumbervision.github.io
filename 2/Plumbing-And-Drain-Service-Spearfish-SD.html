<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill.
