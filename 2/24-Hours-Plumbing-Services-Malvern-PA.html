<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Malvern PA</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Typically, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water till it remains in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers hard water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
