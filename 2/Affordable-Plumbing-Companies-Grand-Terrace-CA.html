<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Grand Terrace CA 92313</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
