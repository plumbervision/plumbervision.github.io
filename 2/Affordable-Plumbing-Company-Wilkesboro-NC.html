<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Wilkesboro NC</h3>
<p>A newly installed hot water heater must not produce unusual sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things aggravate considerably for homes with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. A water heater replacement may be essential if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
