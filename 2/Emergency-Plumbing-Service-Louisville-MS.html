Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with.

For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
