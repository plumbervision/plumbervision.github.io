You might have an idea of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, spend the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will likewise understand the areas to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to recognize.</p>
