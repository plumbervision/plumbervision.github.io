The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage just for non-health danger or health danger conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
