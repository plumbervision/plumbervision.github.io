<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of least expensive pressure.

The need upstream could trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<h3>Water Filtration Systems in Lynchburg Virginia</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
