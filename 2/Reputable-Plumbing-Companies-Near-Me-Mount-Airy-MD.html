Characteristics with water wells: Properties on well water must have an RP backflow preventer on their service line isolating the general public water system from the residential or commercial property. The RP for a home with a water well must be tested upon installation and then annually.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
