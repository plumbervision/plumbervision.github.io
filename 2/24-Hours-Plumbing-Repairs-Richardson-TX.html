<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Such possible health dangers are alarming, however they aren't the only problem. Backflow can also be extremely pricey to remediate.

Fair point. However water softeners were developed to fight a surprisingly common problem: hard water.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are harmless, however gradually they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site supply of water and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of defense for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>Changing pipes between the sink and the wall is cheaper than if a plumber needs to cut into a wall to replace damaged pipes, which can cost around $400, depending upon the size of the job.
