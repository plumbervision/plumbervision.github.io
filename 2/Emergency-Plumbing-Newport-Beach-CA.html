The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They should be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
