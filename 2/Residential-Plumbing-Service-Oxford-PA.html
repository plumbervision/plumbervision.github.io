<p>Specialized Salts: Various geographic locations have different water sources and mineral content. Diamond Crystal ® products address specific problems such as iron concentration, rust stains and salt content. Not sure whether you have a backflow prevention device set up?

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
