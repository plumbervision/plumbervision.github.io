For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
