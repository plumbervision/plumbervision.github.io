<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Installing a hot water heater is not as easy as hooking up a couple of hose pipes. Water heaters need space to operate securely and a poorly installed system can be a constant source of threat in your house. When you hire a licensed professional, you can be sure your unit is set up appropriately both for safety, optimal performance, and maximum energy cost savings.</p>
