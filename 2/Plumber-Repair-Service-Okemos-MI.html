<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
