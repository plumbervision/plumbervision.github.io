<p>Disputing whether to repair or replace your hot water heater? Our professionals will provide you a truthful recommendation. In general, older hot water heater (over 8-10 years) experiencing repeating problems are much better off being replaced. A newer, more effective water heater will conserve you in repair costs and energy in time. Old-fashioned water softeners are infamous for causing a spike in the cost of your monthly energy bills. Many require big quantities of water and can be costly for the electrical energy expense, but the NuvoH2O system is different. Our saltless WATER conditioning system uses up to 4x less water than others and needs no electrical energy.</p>
