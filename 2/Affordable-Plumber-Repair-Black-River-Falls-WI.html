<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers.
