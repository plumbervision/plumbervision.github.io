<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride.

<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature appliance wires connected, and others do not. Get rid of the cover plate underneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's guidelines if yours doesn't. A lot of standard disposals have you attach white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. When you're ended up, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage concerns. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to get rid of any stuck-on particles. Pour hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and salt in the garbage disposal to remove grease. Another great trick is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
