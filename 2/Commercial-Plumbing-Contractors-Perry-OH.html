<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be hard to identify and can also harm your residential or commercial property. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are likewise a health hazard and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and trigger separations. Our plumbers typically perform a color test to determine the source due to the fact that the source of leaking water can be tough to find.

Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not always dirty or tarnished and often gets incorrect for a supply of water line leak.</p>
