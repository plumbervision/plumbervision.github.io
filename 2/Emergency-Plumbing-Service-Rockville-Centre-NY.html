<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Rockville Centre NY</h3>
<p>Many houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
