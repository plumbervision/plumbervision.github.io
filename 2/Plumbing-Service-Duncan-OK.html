<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Duncan OK</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Likewise called cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we turn on our end to unclog drains.
