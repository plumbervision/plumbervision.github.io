<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Yarmouth ME 04096</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
