<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
