<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
