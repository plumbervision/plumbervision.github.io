<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of most affordable pressure.

The need upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
