Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
