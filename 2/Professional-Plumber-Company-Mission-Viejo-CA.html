<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. If the pipes that need to be repaired run below landscaping or underneath your home or structure.

Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most large cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
