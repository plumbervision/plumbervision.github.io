The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They must be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to likewise be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only protect versus back siphonage.</p>
