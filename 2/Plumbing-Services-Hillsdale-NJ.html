<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Section 106.2.2 shall apply to small repairs and replacement piping just. In buildings aside from Group R-3 occupancies, a license and inspection will be needed for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor level, area, or wing is involved, although the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall building plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
