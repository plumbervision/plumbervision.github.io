<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
