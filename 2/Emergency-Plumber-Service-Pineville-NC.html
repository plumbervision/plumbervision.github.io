<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Pineville NC 28134</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Upon earning a high school diploma or GED, potential plumbing contractors need to start a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most common method for plumbers to learn the skills needed to end up being effective in the trade. The majority of apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor companies. Programs normally last 4 to five years and require apprentices to complete a particular variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
