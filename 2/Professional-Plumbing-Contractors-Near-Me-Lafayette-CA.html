<p>A water softener is composed of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It collects hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often utilized for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The result of our innovative water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still preserving an effective flow rate.</p>
<p>To eliminate the smells, first try pouring BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also try 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm water down the drain. Inaccessible or insufficient cleanouts: No matter how effective a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time. Homeowners and plumbers need to be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this takes place. Structures without enough cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at risk of a pipe rupturing.</p>
