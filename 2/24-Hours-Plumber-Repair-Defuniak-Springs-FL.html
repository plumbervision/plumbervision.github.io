<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>

When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
