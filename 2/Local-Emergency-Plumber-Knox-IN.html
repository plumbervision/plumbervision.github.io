<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements.

As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
