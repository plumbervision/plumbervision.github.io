This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>

Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c at (913) 432-3342 for expert Merriam hot water heater services. In some cases water backs up from clogged kitchen sinks.
