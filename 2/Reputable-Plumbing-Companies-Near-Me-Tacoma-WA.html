<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from rust and may place toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house.
