Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
