<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

<p>Leakages - If your hot water heater is leaking, you might need to replace the unit. Gradually leaks can trigger other issues and even trigger mold to grow around the system. Get it fixed as quickly as you can if you notice a leak. Connecting watering to water fountains, pool and garden ponds forbade: State law and City regulation hold that no irrigation system may be linked to a fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water features may just be filled with potable water. Water which has actually entered an irrigation system is not potable.</p>

<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Deterioration can actually consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer.

<p>Local laws require yearly inspections to guarantee your backflow prevention devices are working as they need to be since water contamination could position a serious public health threat. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear gradually and it's important that they receivethe same routine maintenance that your car or HEATING AND COOLING system gets to guarantee your household's water is clean & safe.</p>
