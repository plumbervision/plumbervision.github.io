It is probably due to too much usage over a long duration of time if there are leakages coming from your system. A number of these leakages can be fixed, however if they end up being bigger and more regular, you need to consider total system replacement.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of the Plumbing Department is to perform cross connection inspections to determine safe and clean water systems that require being safeguarded from contaminates.
