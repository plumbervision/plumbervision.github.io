<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
