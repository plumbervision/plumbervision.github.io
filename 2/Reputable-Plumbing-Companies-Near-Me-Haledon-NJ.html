<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Haledon NJ</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Whenever you switch on a hot water tap in your house, cold water goes into the heater through a pipe. The sensor inside the heater switches on an electric element or a burner depending upon the kind of tankless heater you have actually chosen. Water is quickly heated and provided through the warm water tap. There is definitely no need to wait for hot water as there is no tank and all the water is heated instantly.</p>
