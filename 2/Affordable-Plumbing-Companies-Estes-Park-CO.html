<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust certification standards. An excellent rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs costly and difficult, indicating a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller individual service pipes, bring water to private homes, apartment shops, buildings and services. Depending on demand, these pipes range in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water gets in the customer facility by means of a water meter that records circulation rates and water utilization for billing functions. Private service pipelines are generally made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be important.</p>
