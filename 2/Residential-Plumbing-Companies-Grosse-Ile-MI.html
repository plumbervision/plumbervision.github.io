<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But finding the ideal washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
