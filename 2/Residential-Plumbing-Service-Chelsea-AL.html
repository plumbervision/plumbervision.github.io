<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce weird sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify dramatically for families with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be needed.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
