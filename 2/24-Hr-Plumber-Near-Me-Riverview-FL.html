If you observe that your plumbing suffers from various obstructions, leakages, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you ought to consult a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
