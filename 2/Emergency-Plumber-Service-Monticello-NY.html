<p>If you discover an odor or unpleasant smell originating from your system, which is not unusual, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are widely readily available and easy to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the water supply to your home at the main line.

<p>It's Making Noise - As your water warms, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create sound. If your energy costs are rising, a new, higher effectiveness water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing hard water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new place and placed there.</p>
