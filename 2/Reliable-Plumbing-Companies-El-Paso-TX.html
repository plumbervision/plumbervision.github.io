<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
