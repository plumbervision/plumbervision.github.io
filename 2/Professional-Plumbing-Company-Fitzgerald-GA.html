<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
