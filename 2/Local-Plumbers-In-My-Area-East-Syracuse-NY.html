<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in East Syracuse NY 13057</h3>

The problem with this kind of plastic piping is it can end up being fragile and break easily, especially if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down.

So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
