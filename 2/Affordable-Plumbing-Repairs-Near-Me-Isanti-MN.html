For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated effectively using vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electrical models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
