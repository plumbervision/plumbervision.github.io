<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Palatine IL 60074</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
