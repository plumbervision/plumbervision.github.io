<p>Minerals in water are what makes sure water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Usually, minerals arrive since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water till it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers tough water.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a small round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank.
