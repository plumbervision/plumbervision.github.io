<h3>Clogged Drain Services in Hazard KY 41701</h3>
<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be difficult to find and can also damage your residential or commercial property. Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health risk and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and cause separations. Our plumbers often perform a dye test to identify the source due to the fact that the source of leaking water can be hard to detect. Typically, pipes or water service lines are replaced, just to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly unclean or blemished and frequently gets mistaken for a water system line leak.</p>
