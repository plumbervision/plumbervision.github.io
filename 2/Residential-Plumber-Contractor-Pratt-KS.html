We are now ready to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the components to be eliminated in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is very important to put them back in the proper location. It is likewise crucial that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the components or inadvertently positioned in the body.
