<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term service if you do have regular leaks.</p>
