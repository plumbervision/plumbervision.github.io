<p>Water heaters can be an expensive investment for homeowners that they deal with for over a years. That's why when it's time to equip your brand-new home or replace your old hot water heater, it is very important to consider the cost, effectiveness, and longevity of a new unit. Plumbers generally charge $45 to $65 an hour and can usually install a water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature appliance wires attached, and others do not. Remove the cover plate below the disposal and attach the wires according the producer's guidelines if yours doesn't. A lot of standard disposals have you connect white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. When you're ended up, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
