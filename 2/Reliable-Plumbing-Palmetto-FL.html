<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
