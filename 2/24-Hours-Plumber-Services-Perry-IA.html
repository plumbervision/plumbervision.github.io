<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical solution, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
