<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
