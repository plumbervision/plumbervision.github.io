<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are thought about a health hazard if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area must be indicated on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and after that every year.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might lead to incorrect information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that might damage elements. The impacts of elevated temperature level can also cause extreme pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be recognized and their cause remedied. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected, the new parts can quickly be made inoperative.</p>
