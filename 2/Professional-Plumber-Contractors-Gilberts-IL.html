<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Gilberts IL</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
