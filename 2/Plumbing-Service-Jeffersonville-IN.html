<h3>Reduce The Cost Of Hiring A Plumber Jeffersonville IN</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the assistance of a professional. Some minor clogs can be taken care of with a plunger and typically, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, certain problems do require a trained plumber, and it's important to understand the distinction to avoid wasted time, money, and aggravation.</p>

<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Jeffersonville IN 47130?</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
