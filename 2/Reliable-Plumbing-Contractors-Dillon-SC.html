<p>Leaks are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
