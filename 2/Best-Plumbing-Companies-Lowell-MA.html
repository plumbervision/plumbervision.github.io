<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the same thing, but without the zinc covering.

<h3>Bathroom Faucet Repair in Lowell Massachusetts</h2>
