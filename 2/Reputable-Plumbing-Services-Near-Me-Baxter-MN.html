<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Baxter MN 56425</h3>

I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214.
