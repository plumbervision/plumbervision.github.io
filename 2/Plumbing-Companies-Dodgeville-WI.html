The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health threat or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
