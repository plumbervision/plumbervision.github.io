<p>The concern of leakage can be credited to any variety of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that happens when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, hence the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to split and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
