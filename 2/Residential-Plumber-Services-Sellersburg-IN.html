<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
