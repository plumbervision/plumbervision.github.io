<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Brookville IN 47012</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
