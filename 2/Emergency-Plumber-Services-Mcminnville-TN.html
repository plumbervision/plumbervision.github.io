<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has actually been arranged using the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors may be called in between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection. The inspectors will organize their daily work schedules and do not know what inspections have actually been asked for prior to the inspection date.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are safe, but over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
