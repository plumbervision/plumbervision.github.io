<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing suffers from various obstructions, leaks, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
