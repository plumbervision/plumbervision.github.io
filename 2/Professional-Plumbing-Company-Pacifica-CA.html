<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted issues on your home. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
