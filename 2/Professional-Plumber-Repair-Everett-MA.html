<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
