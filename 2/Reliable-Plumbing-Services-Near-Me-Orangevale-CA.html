Therefore, you only consist of the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your estimation. Many makers do not have pressure loss information for vacuum breakers, so assume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no maker's literature is available.</p>
<p>Another frustrating issue is when the flush valve in the tank stops working or uses out. If you hear the toilet running constantly or periodically you probably need the valve or float replaced.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
