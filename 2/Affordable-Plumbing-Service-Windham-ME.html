<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Windham ME</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems need the help of a professional. Some minor blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a basic matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, specific issues do call for an experienced plumber, and it is essential to understand the difference to avoid lost time, money, and frustration.</p>
