<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>If your issue is more related to scale and mineral build-up, it's important to be mindful that most scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by difficult water. Tough water generally leaves lime and calcium buildup which can end up being quite undesirable. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning methods will certainly assist, we highly suggest you check out setting up a water softener to aid with your tough water.</p>
