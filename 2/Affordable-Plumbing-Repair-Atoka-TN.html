<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
