Depending on the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up.
