<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
