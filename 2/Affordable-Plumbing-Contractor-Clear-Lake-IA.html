<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Clear Lake IA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
