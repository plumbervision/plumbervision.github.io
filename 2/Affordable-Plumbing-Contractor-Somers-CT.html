<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, as with each person we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, timely, and really well-informed.

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If everything is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the overall expenses. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
