<p>Also, if you have a 2-story home, it'll be more expensive to repipe because the plumber will need to navigate through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a huge job - and it's a job you wish to get right. But the range of plumbing pipe products to select from can make it complicated.

Double Check Valve Assembly (DC): A DC is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
