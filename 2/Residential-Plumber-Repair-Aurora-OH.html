Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different celebrations, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, as with everyone we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and very well-informed. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or little job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly necessary, often the plumber may have to repair or upgrade circuitry to power the new garbage disposal. This usually costs an extra $50 to $100+.
