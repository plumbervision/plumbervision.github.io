A gas leak can result in a fire, and even an explosion, or cause physical tension on the body that leads to headaches, fatigue, dizziness, inflammation to eyes and throat, chest discomforts, calling in the ears, nosebleeds, and more. In reality, Carbon monoxide gas poisoning is a typical impact of without treatment gas line repair jobs. Outside of physical damage, gas line leaks can also trigger serious damage to your pipes, suggesting more of your hard-earned cash invested in repairs.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

The team at Johnson Heating & Cooling Inc can set you up with a maintenance plan so that we are carefully monitoring your heater before problem happens.</p>
