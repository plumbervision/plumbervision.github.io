<h3>Blocked Sewer in Browns Mills NJ 08015 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
