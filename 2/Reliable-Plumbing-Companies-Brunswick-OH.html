<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Brunswick OH</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
