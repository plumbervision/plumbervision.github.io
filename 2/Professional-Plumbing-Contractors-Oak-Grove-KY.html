Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need several aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically apart sources.</p>
