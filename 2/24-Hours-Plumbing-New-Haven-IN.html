When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
