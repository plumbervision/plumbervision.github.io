<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Shawnee OK</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
