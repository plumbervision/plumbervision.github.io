<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and private on-site water supply and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow techniques supply an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>Most plumbers will remove the old system to install the brand-new one at the very same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the brand-new unit, for that reason increasing costs. This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old unit is to get rid of. In a lot of cases, removal will only include an extra $25 to $50 to the total expenses, however in many cases the costs might be greater if additional pipes need to also be changed.</p>
