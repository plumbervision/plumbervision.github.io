<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Logan UT</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may look like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners may be an affordable solution, the extreme ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, with time, creating vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair at Logan UT 84321</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
