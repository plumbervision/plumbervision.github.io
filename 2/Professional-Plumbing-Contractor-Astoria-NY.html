<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you think! When you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it takes place at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
