<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Lake Station IN</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
