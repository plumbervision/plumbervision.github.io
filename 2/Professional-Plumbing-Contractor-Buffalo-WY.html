<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different kinds of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from rust and might position contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your house.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
