<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages fixed and couldn't be happier with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>Once permit applications are made, plans are evaluated by the City for code compliance. There is a charge of $15 per 1000 square feet of work and a minimum fee of $15 for examining plans for homes, garages, sheds, fences, and swimming pools. The review period varies according to the job's complexity. In general, evaluation of one- and two-family houses can be completed in 3 to five working days.</p>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, bathtub, or sink) can be corrected quickly if the obstruction is basic and shallow. For many clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this does not resolve the problem then you might also need to contact a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
