If you buy a replacement that's made by the exact same maker as your old model, you might have the ability to bypass the need to replace the waste assembly and mounting flange in the sink, significantly simplifying the job (it can be a larger, more powerful unit-- it just requires to have the exact same mounting flange).</p>
