<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust certification requirements. A great rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages.

Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the entire component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
