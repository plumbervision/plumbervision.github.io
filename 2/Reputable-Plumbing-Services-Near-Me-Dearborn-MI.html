<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
