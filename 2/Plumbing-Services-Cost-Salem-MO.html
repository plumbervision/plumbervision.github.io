<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
