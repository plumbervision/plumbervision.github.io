Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
