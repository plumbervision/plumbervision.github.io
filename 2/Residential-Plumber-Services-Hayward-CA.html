<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken home appliance is irritating to handle, the bright side is that installing a replacement disposal will be more affordable than installing a new garbage disposal in a sink that has never had one before. Depending on the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
