<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does occur regularly than you think! When you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Testing must be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor needs to possess a valid, current plumbing license, existing insurance, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently adjusted test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
