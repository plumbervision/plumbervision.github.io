<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! Frequently it takes place in the evening when you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow.
