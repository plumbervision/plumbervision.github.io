<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
