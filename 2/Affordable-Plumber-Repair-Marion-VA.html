<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.
