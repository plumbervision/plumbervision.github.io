<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to remove chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In homes with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will typically advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting Â® services, depending on the seriousness of the scenario. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
