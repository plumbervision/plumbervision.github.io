Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Some house owners may think about water softeners as a high-end product, something that's nice to have" but not completely required. However, hard water can trigger whatever from small inconveniences, like spots on meals or soap residue, to significant problems like a shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other important house appliances. For these factors and others, a water softener can be an useful investment for your house.</p>
