Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to constructing codes that require the use of fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already, it's most likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in location-- start by removing the old drain. Most drains are connected to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
