Nasty smell: A strong, unpleasant odor coming from your drains could indicate one of two problems: food clogging up the drain, or a larger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of the clog, we may utilize a range of various methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to entirely clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire ports. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp port and get rid of wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>

Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
