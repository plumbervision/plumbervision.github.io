<h3>Shower Repairs in Saginaw MI 48601 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
