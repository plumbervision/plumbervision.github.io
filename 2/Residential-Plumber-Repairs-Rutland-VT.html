<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
