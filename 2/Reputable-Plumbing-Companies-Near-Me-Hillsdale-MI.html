<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
