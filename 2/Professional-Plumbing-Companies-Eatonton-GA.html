<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Eatonton GA 31024</h3>

I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
