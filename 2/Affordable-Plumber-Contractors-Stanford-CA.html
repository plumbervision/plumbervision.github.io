<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Stanford CA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard methods of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
