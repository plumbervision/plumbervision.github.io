<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
