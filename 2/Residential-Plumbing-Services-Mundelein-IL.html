<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur regularly than you think! Often it occurs at night when you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
