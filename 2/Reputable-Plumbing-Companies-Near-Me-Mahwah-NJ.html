<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products.

PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
