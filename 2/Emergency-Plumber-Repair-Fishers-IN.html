<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
