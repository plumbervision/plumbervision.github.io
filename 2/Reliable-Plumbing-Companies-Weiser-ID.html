<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
