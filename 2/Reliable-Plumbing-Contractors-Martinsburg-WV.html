<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a good indication, a weird gurgling sound. Do not depend upon a plunger to remedy the issue-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair.

Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Generally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
