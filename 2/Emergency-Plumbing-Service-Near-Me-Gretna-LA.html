<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can produce sound. If your energy costs are rising, a brand-new, greater effectiveness hot water heater can bring them pull back. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling tough water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its new place and positioned there.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex clinical process, but easy to correct. It utilizes salt to eliminate odors and minerals found in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
