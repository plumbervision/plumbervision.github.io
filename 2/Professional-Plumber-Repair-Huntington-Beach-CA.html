<h3>Shower Repairs in Huntington Beach CA 92647 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and changed with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
