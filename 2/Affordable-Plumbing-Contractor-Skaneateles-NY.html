<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
