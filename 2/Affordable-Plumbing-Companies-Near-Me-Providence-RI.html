These people are truly the best. Terrific costs, everyone I have had the pleasure of dealing with has actually been so kind and responsive too I strongly recommend using their services.</p>

<p>Many property owners will observe a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical might finish the job, it's in fact quite destructive to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners frequently utilize lye as the active ingredient.

<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
