<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
