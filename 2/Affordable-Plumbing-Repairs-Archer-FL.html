<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Installing the brand-new drain is a simple matter: First, create a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top.

I just recently had to replace the water heater in my house and it was only 6 years old. Traditional water heaters with a tank ought to generally last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been used in more than two years. Washing meals is my least preferred task, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
