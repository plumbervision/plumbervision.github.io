<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Coronado CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
