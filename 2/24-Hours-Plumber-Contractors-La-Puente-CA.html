<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
