If you discover that your plumbing suffers from various blockages, leakages, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you should seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. Homeowners ought to check water pressure coming into their house on a routine basis. Water pressure must have to do with 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
