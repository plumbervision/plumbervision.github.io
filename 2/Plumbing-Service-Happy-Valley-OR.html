It is once again important for the repair specialist to be familiar with the hardness of the products so that their cleaning process is not harmful. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to reduce any scale growth or rust. It is very important that the repair professional is delicate to the hardness and kind of the various coatings used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective finishing.</p>
