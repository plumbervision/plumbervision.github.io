<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three various events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful.

<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to secure them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only remove as much structure material as necessary to reach, separate, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. You can set up to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you want.</p>
