Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.
