<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water.
