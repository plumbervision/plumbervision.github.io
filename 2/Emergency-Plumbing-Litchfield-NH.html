<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does take place more frequently than you think! Often it happens during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>It's an oddly intricate scientific procedure, but easy to remedy. It utilizes salt to remove minerals and odors found in difficult water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and attract salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
