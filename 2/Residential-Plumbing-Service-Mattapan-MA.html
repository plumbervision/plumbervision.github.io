While knowledgeable about copper pipe, many homeowners a may be not familiar with PEX and unaware of the benefits of water line leaks repiping in PEX.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
