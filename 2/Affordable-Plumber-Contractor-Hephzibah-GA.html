Rather than removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
