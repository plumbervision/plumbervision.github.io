<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
