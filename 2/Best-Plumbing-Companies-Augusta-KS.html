<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
