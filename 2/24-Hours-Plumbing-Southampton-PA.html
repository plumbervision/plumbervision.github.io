<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will develop a good seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
<p>Water staining: Another obvious indication of your pipes decomposing is brown or yellow water coming out of your sinks or tub. Step 2: On the brand-new drain, use plumber's putty around the flange, and press it into location. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving. If you require garbage disposal repair, we can also help. One of our professionals will come out to find the issue and get your disposal working in no time.</p>
