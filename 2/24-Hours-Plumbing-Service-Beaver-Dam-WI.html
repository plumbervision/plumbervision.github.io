<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. The majority of toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area involve clogged drains, which occur when products get stuck in the pipes. Sometimes, this involves bodily waste and can be cleared up with sensible use of a plunger. When it doesn't, however, you need a certified plumber to make it right.

<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable).

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
