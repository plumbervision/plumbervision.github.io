A gas leak can have almost immediate impacts on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. If you've got a gas pipe leaking, get out of your home and call us immediately.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where firmness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline kind that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regeneration.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
