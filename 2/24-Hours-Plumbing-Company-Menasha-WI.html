<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Tankless electrical water heaters can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are big and powerful enough to supply hot water to all bathrooms, kitchens, and devices in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that supply warm water to specific rooms or appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same way. The only distinction is the amount of water they can heat up at any offered time. Also, whole-house units are significantly more expensive than the point of usage systems.</p>
