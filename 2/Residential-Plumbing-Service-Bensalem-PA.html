Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
