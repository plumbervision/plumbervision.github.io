Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
