<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup might still take place.</p>
