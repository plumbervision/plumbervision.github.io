<p>Most importantly, never ever plant anything up versus your home, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your home to the city line.) If you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have a concept of where your lateral lies. If you do not understand, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to prevent. Your line will be easy to determine if you have a clean-out.</p>
