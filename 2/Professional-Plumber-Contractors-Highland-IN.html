<p>Checking the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be major problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home should have water.

<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the house. Normally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>In order to insure the proper operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it needs to be tested and certified upon installation and at least once a year afterwards if installed to safeguard form a health threat situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers oversee these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear, or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be checked regularly to guarantee that they are working correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested with correctly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
