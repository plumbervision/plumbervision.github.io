Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get changed when repiped.</p>
<p>Installed under the sink, the garbage disposal is suggested for chopping up small bits of waste food. When turned on the motor spins and impellers-- likewise called lugs-- toss bits of food versus a mill ring. You should always run water while using the waste disposal unit; once the waste disposal unit does its task, the water flushes the finely chopped particles down the drain.</p>
