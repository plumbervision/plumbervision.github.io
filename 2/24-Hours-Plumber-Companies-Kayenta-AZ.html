<p>In supply of water systems, water is typically preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
