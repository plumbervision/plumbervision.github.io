<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Burleson TX</h3>
<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A small cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the new line throughout installation. Less parts in the unit result in less tankless water heater repair appointments.</p>
