<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Examiner for the group. Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would generally trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually become broken and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater very rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>When the flush valve in the tank fails or uses out, another irritating issue is. , if you hear the toilet running continuously or periodically you probably need the valve or float replaced.. Failing to repair a running toilet can result in wasted water and a really high water bill. Water in Florida is costly so do not postpone-- get a running toilet fixed.</p>

<p>As always, if you smell gas or believe a gas leak, leave the area right away on foot. Do NOT use your phone, electric switches, computer, or anything that could cause a trigger.
