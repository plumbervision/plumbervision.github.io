<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
