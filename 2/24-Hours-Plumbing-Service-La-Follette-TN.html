<p>The sewer line in your house is a major part of your home's plumbing. Your sewer line belongs to your water system that carries out all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets. Keeping tabs on the status of your system is a fundamental part of being a property owner. Left ignored, sewer line problems can cost countless dollars in repairs and damage to your house.</p>
<p>Firstly, never ever plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your house to the city line.) You might have a concept of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps go into and break the line. If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the locations to prevent. Your line will be easy to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage issues. When a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on particles. Put warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and table salt in the garbage disposal to remove grease. Another great technique is utilizing a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
