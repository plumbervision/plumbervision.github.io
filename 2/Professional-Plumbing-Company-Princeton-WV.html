<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a really pricey alternative.</p>

When switched on the motor spins and impellers-- likewise called lugs-- throw little bits of food against a mill ring.
