<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
