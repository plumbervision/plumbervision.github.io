Thermostat concerns: The thermostat manages the temperature of the hot water heater. You might be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this part breakdowns.</p>

A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and just needs to be changed.</p>
