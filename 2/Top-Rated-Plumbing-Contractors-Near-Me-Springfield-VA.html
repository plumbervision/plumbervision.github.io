This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
