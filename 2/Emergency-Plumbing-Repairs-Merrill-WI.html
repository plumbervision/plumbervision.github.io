Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
