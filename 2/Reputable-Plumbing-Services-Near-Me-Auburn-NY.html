For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a practical source of gas developed. Another function of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>Once you've found the trip lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you've secured the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
