<p>When choosing an insured and licensed plumbing contractor is simply a basic phone call away, why run the risk of an insurance coverage claim on a flooded house.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
