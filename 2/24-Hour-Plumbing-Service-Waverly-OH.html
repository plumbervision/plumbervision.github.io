Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.)

<h3>Blocked Sewer in Waverly OH 45690 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
