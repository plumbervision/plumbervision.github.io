<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Mahomet IL</h3>
<p>A freshly set up hot water heater should not produce odd noises, but it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to warm the water. Things worsen significantly for families with a high need for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it remains in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
