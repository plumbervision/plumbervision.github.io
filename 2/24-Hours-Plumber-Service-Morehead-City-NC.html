<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-lasting service if you do have regular leakages.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
