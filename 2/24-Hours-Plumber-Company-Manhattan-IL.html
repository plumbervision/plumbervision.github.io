<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
