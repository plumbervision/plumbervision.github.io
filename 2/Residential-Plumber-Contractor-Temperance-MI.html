<p>An unusual gurgling sound when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never an excellent sign. Do not depend upon a plunger to correct the problem-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair.

Most fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Normally, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
