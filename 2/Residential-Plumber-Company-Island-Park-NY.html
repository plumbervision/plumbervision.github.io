<p>Whether you need electric, gas, or tankless water heaters, we have the ideal one for your house. The most popular and standard style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electric tank system.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
