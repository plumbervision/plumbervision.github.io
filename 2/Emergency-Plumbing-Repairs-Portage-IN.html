Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. A little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.
