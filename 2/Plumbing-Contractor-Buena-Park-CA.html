This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
