<p>Lots of house owners will see a clog and right away grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this type of chemical may get the job done, it's really quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners frequently use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is designed to penetrate clogs and liquify them, but it also eats through your pipes and develops weak spots that are prone to burst.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
