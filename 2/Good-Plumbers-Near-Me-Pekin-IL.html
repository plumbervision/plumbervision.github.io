<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water flowing in your home. The factors for this can vary from leakages, malfunctioning or faulty electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed problems, a repair or replacement of the parts may be enough. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a water heater replacement is essential.</p>
