Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut down while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disturbance to your everyday regimen. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furnishings to protect them from dust and particles.
