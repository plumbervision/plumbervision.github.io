<p>Most homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
