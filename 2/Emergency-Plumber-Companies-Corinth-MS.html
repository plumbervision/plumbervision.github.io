<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
