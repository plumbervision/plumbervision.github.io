<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>When selecting a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is just a simple phone call away, why run the risk of an insurance claim on a flooded house. A malfunctioning toilet is one household issue most of us would rather avoid. Nevertheless, you can not disregard a toilet problem.
