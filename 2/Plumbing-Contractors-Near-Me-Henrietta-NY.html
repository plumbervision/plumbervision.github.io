<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our rigid trust certification standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and corroded parts make repairs costly and challenging, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
