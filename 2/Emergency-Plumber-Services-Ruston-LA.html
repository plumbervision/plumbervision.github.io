<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
