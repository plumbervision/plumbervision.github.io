<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in various parts of the plumbing system, a lot of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow problems or even stop a component from flowing altogether. The next typical issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it reduces the readily available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Prior to installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue.
