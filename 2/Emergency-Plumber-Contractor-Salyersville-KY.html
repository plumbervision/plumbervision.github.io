<p>At Apollo Plumbing Service, a crucial aspect of our work includes cleaning services to bring back drains and pipes to proper performance. Not just are our solutions based upon environmentally friendly, safe processes, however we likewise are proud to use several types of solutions so that we are gotten ready for any scenario. Connect the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from underneath the sink. Ensure you snap the backup ring in place.</p>
<p>Prior to installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is attached to its mount.
