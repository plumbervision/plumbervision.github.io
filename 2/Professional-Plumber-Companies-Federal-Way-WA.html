<p>You might have heard stories about a hot water heater taking off inside a house or company! It is necessary to comprehend that a plugged temperature level and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your hot water heater into a harmful time bomb. The age of your water heater. A conventional tank hot water heater usually lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless water heater can last approximately 20 with proper maintenance and care.
