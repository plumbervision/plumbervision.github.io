<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is taking place.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
