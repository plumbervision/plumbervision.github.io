<h3>Drain Clearing in Birmingham Alabama</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to remove chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house. Even if the issue comes from with the municipal system, it's still wise to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are developed to enable the elements to be removed for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary most of the times. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to assist in a repair. Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>

You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
