<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.
