<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains at once in your home, then that typically means that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in numerous areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
