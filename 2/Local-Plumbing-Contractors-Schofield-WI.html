If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a prompt way, the opportunities are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>Before selection and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature varieties. All assemblies should be protected from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used. Consult makers requirements for suggestions.
