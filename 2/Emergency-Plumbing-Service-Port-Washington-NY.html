<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps record wetness and sediment so that they do not go into the control system.

These devices go through testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they are subject to regular tests later, as well.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
