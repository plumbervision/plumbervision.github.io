<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does take place more often than you believe! Often it occurs at night when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
