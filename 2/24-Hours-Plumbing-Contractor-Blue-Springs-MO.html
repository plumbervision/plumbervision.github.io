<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
