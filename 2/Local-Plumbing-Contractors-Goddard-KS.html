<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Goddard KS 67052?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type active ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate.
