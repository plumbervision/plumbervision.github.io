<p>Plumbing work shall not be commenced till an authorization for such work has been issued by the Commissioner. A plumbing authorization will just be issued to a City of Buffalo Licensed Master Plumber. A plumbing permit is not transferable. A plumbing permit may be provided to a specific resident owner, who has shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Permit and Inspection Services that they are personally certified to carry out such plumbing work within their own home.</p>
