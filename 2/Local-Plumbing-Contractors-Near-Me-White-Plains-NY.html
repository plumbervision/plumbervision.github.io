<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning in White Plains NY 10605</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
