<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
