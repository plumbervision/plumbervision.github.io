This is an ideal version as waste from the dishwasher can wash straight into the disposal system. Even if you don't require for a dishwasher, if your house ever changes hands, new owners might appreciate the option.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
