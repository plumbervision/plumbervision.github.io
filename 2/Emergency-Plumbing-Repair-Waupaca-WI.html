The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They should be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
