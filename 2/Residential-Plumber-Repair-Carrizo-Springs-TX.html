<p>Finally, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
