These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
