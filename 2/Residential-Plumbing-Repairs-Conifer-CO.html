The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion assists require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>These are all indications that your unit ought to be inspected by a plumber. We don't advise attempting to repair this specific home appliance by yourself, due to the fact that it does provide a security hazard, due to the sharp blades that are used to slice and grind waste.
