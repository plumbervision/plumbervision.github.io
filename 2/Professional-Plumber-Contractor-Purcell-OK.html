<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters must have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and products. Suggestion: Location a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only feasible alternative.</p>
