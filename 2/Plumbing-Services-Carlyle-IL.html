These liquified ions give tough water its attributes.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are safe, however over time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical.
