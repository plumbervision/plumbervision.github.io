<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
