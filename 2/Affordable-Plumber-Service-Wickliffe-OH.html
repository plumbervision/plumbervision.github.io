<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
