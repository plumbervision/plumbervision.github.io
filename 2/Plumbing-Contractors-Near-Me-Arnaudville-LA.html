When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, along with examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
