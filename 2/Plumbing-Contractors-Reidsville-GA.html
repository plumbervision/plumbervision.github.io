<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
