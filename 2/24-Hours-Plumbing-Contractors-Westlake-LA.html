<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Westlake LA</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
