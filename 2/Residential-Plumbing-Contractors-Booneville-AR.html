Cloudy scum builds up on your shower curtains and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in difficult water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair sticky and lifeless.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
