<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Saint Albans NY</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
