<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>There are many parts to a toilet that work together to make it function. If it is not flushing correctly, there could be a concern with the deal with or the lift arm. It could also be the flush lever or the flapper. A skilled professional would have the ability to detect which part is failing to make the toilet repair immediately.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
