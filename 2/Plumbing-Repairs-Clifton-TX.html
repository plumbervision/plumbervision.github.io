<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
<p>You'll need to install that first if your disposal's installation will need a brand-new mounting flange in the sink. Remove it as discussed above if you're changing an old disposer.
