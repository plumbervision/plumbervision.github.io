<h3>Sewer Drain in Elba Alabama</h2>
<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, an unique type of black pipe need to be utilized that is coated with an unique plastic material that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and also due to the fact that the plastic finish really secures the pipe much better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
