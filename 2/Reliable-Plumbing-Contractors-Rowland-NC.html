Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health danger if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply.

<p>Two designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to isolate health or non-health hazards but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
