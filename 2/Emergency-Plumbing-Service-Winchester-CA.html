<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might result in incorrect data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly.
