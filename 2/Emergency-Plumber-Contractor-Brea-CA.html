<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
