<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Placentia California</h2>
<p>As always, if you smell gas or think a gas leak, leave the area instantly on foot. Do NOT utilize your phone, electrical switches, computer system, or anything that could cause a spark. Go straight to a safe area in a neighboring house or structure, and after that call 911 and CenterPoint Energy at 1-800-296-9815 or 612-372-5050 immediately. Position the water softener.

<p>We'll reveal you three common gas piping scenarios. We'll reveal you one method to make each connection, but there are other similarly legitimate ways using common plumbing parts. Do not be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they simply represent female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you buy the parts, do not hesitate to request for help. Then screw all the gas line parts together to ensure they fit.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.

Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
