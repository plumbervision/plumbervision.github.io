This is just one of numerous problems that can crop up.</p>
<p>When a plumbing authorization has been provided in error since of incorrect, unreliable or insufficient info, or the work for which the authorization was provided breaks the Uniform Code, such permit will be withdrawed or suspended up until such time as the license holder shows that all work completed and all work proposed will be in compliance with relevant provisions of the code.</p>
