When the day comes that it stops working, this method you will not have a surprise expenditure on your hands.</p>
<p>Examine to ensure it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make sure it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the system below the sink.</p>
