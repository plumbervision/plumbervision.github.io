<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were wonderful. They quickly found the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, similar to each person we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, prompt, and extremely educated.
