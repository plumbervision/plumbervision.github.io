<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Montrose CA 91020</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
