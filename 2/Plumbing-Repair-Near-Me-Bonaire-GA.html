<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
