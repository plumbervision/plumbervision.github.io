<p>Plastic pipe is in large use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century however did not end up being practical to make until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe started to be made in the 1940s and was in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a range of fittings and products employed.</p>
<p>The usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
