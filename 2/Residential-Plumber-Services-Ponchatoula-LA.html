<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Installing the new drain is a simple matter: First, create a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top. Then install the leading half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and mounting bracket on from beneath. Make sure to get rid of any excess plumber's putty utilizing a putty knife.
