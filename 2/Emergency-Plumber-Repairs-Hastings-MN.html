<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Hastings MN</h3>
<p>Bought middle ground stainless steel blade model offered at Lowes. Got a little local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 men. There are numerous reasons that you may need to call a plumber to come to your house and unclog drains. No matter what the cause of your concern, our drain cleaning service specialists will take care of you as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
