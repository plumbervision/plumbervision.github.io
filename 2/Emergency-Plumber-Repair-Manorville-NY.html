The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
