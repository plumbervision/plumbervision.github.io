<p>These are all signs that your system ought to be examined by a plumber. We don't recommend trying to repair this specific device on your own, since it does present a safety hazard, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to chop and grind waste. You ought to also prevent utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit since these chemicals will only damage the appliance even more.</p>
<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any number of aspects which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank ought to have some room to represent the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to break and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
