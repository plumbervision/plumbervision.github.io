<h3>Unclog Drain in Slippery Rock Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with toilet, particles, or hair paper? After years of usage, drains can collect destructive build-up. This build-up blocks water flow, ultimately backing up your drains till they are unusable. Typically, all the pipes need is a good scrubbing. We can achieve this through a range of techniques such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we may utilize a variety of various methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out everything inside your drains.

If there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already, it's most likely that the brand-new unit will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by getting rid of the old drain. The majority of drains are connected to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
