<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it could wreak undesirable issues on your property. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Like any major appliance, your water heater will begin to wear down and reveal signs of aging.
