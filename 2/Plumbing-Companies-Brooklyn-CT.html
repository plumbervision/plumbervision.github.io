<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are set up in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>If it slowly drains away as you work, add more hot water. Keep plunging till the drain is clear or you decide it's time to attempt a brand-new method.
