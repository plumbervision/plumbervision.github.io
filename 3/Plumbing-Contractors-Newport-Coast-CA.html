<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Newport Coast CA 92657</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
