<p>High water pressure also leads to thermal growth in water heaters which can result in possible water damage if the water heater leaks or burst. The more of these components you have, the more costly the job will be. That's since the plumber has to replace the secondary drain and inbound lines (see image below) for each plumbing fixture. Changing the pipes for lots of plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>2. Demand-initiated softeners regrow when they notice their softening capability is low as identified by a preset number gotten in by the user.

Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
