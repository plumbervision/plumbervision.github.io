<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>DCVs are specifically designed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The essential for typical fire defense applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 separately running spring-loaded check valves (typically inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.
