<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Mahopac NY</h3>
<p>When we handle your gas or lp pipe installation and gas pipe repair, you can unwind and use your gas piping without any concern. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>During regrowth, the water softener will take the brine option into the softener tank and the ion exchange process takes place once again, just this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.
