<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
