<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly alternative.</p>
<p>Another obligation of the Plumbing Department is to carry out cross connection inspections to recognize drinkable water systems that are in need of being safeguarded from contaminates. The cross connection control program is required by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399.
