<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be examined. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated.

The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be checked once again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flowchart is necessary to ensure it was repaired appropriately. An effectively fixed assembly should provide years of protection.</p>
