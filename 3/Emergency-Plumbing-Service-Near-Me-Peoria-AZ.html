<p>Find the right water softener for you. One common method for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and contaminating the public water system.</p>
