If you have inside-the-wall supply pipes that need replacement, your plumber might have the ability to limit the wall demolition he requires to do by utilizing an alternative piping item: Cross-linked polyethylene tubing, also called PEX, is a flexible plastic hose.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require slightly various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
