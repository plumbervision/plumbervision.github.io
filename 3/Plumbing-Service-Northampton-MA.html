<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
