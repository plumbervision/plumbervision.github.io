<p>If you see an odor or undesirable smell coming from your unit, which is not uncommon, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can escape. These flanges are simple and commonly available to install, costing around $30 in your home enhancement or hardware shops. Turn off the water system to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing throughout the installation process, turned off the water supply to your house. Make sure your water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electrical power going to the unit.</p>
<p>These are all signs that your unit need to be inspected by a plumber. We don't recommend trying to repair this specific home appliance on your own, due to the fact that it does provide a security hazard, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and slice waste. Due to the fact that these chemicals will only damage the appliance further, you should also prevent utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great.
