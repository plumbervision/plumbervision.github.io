<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water system and private on-site water system and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow techniques provide an increased level of defense for the general public supply of water system.</p>

These flanges are commonly available and easy to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the water supply to your home at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing during the installation process, turned off the water system to your house.
