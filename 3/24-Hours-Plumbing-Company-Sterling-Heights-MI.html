<p>In water system systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or stop working reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
