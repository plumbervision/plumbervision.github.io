In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dose, water firmness, and washing temperature to see if firmness had an effect on detergent savings. The study included tests that got rid of challenging soils, in addition to evaluating finding and recording. Researchers found that softened water utilizes almost 30% less cleaning agent, however cleans as well as water at 10 gpg solidity level. That detergent savings rises to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
