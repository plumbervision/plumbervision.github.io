<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
