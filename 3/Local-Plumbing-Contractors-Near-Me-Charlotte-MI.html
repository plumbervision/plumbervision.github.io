<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and crack or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.
