<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>When permit applications are made, plans are reviewed by the City for code compliance. There is a charge of $15 per 1000 square feet of work and a minimum charge of $15 for reviewing plans for homes, garages, sheds, fences, and swimming pools. The review duration differs according to the project's complexity. In basic, evaluation of one- and two-family homes can be finished in 3 to 5 working days.</p>
