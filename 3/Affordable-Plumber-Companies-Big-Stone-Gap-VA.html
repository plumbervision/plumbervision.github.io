<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Big Stone Gap VA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is actually changing a gas line - if it's malfunctioning it needs to be changed. The cost of gas line replacement is figured out by the cost of labor and products. The variation of the cost depends on whether the project is a simple gas leak repair or a full replacement of the gas line system. Extra gas line installation for new devices are charged individually.</p>
