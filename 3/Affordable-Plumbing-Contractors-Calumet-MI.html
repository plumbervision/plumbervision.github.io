If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
