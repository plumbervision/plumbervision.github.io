<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Wynnewood PA</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
