<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
