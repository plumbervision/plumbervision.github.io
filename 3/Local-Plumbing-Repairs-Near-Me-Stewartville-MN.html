<p>More than often, small leakages in our houses are easily repaired through welding and we overlook it as a minor concern. However if the leakage problems are frequent and every now and then some or the other corner of your house has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to inspect the entire piping system to carry out house repiping. Numerous leaks shouldn't be overlooked at all; else it might cause complicated flooding issue soon.</p>
