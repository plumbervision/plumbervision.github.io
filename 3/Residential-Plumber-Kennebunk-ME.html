When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
