<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Service in Geneseo</h2>

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping.
