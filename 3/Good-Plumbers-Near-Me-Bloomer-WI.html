<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

Depending upon the flow capacity, place and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a variety of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter reinforced concrete.</p>
