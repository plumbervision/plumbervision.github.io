<p>Once you've found the journey lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank.

Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you've protected the trip lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
