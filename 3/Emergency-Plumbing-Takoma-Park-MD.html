<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is essential to the security of your workers and clients. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Slide the new hot water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings. Balance out the lines as required with sets of 45-degree elbows if the tubing does not line up.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
