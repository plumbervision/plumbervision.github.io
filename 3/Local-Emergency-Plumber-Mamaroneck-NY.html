<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Mamaroneck NY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
