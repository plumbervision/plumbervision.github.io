<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Mason City IA</h3>
<p>A newly set up water heater must not produce unusual sounds, however it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things intensify significantly for families with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
