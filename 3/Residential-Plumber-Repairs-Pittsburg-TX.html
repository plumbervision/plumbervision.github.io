<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from rust and might put toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your house.

When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
