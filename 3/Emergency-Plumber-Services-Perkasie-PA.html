<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

A lot of plumbers are certified to install disposals, however if a GFCI outlet is needed, an electrician may also be needed.
