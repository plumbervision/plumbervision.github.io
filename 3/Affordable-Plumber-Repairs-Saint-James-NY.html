<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to get rid of chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Some pipe products are more affordable than others; some are more susceptible and fragile to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe products have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural stresses and pressures as an outcome of temperature change and ice development. And these differences dictate the prospective need for backflow preventers.</p>
