<p>Your house's drains and pipes silently eliminate thousands of gallons of wastewater from your house every year without you even providing a doubt. However, when hair, food scraps, feminine hygiene items, toys, and other foreign things make their method into your drains, they can cause severe problems.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A garbage disposal is a vital kitchen appliance in many houses today. While most kitchen sink disposers can deal with practically any kind of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Used impellers on older disposals can become ineffective, increasing the danger of drain clogs.</p>
