<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Thomson GA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible service, particularly when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
