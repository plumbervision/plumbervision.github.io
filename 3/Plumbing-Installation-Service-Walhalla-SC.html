In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>

No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does occur more often than you think! Often it happens in the evening when you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes.

Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
