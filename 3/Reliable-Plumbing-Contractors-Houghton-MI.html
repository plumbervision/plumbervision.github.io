<p>Think of residing in a home with soft water-- a home where you do not have strange films on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap quickly, and don't need to worry about scaling on the inside or outside of your devices. Sounds nice, doesn't it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environment-friendly water systems for houses, you can.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific process, but simple to remedy. It uses salt to eliminate smells and minerals discovered in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that connect and bring in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
