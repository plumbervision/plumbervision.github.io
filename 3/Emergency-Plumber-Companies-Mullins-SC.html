It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly.
