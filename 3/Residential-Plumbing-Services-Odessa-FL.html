<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports.
