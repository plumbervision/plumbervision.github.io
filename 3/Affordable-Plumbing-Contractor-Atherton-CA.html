<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>

The mold development would more than likely lag your walls but will start to leak through in time. You will more than likely see a white residue on your wall near to an area where a sewer pipe lies.</p>
