<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Du Quoin IL 62832</h3>

<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
