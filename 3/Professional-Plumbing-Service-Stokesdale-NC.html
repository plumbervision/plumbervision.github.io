Depending on the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the rate.</p>
<p>House owners or plumbers should have an approved permit prior to beginning work or getting an inspection. If you are setting up a new sink, we can also install your brand-new waste disposal unit. We know all the very best brands for garbage disposals and can help you find the right one for your needs.
