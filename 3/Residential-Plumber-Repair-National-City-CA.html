<p>PEX is made from a versatile piping material that is simple and inexpensive to install and is resistant to acidic compounds. However, it can not be used outside because it is damaged by UV light, and it can not be straight connected to a water heater.

Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
