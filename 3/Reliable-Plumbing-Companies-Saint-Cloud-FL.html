If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
