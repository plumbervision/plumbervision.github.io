<p>To link a power cable to the brand-new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation.
