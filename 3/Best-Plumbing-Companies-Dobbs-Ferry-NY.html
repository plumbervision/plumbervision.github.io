<p>Thank you so much for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the holidays. We had actually been on trip during the time of repair and it was soothing to know it had been looked after and prepared to go upon our return. For a plumber specializing in drain-clearing services, expect to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>
