<h3>Water Heater Repair Services in Clinton MA 01510</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
