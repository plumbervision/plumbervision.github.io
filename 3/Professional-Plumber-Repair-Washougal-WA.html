<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Washougal WA 98671</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending on size, brand name and features.</p>
<p>That said, you don't always need to drain tens of thousands of dollars on fixing your house's pipe or sewer lines. With ingenious trenchless technologies, digging, and the therapeutic landscaping that follows, is mostly avoided. Repairs are appropriate for small leaks, specifically if you have plumbing that was set up in simply the past 10 years.
