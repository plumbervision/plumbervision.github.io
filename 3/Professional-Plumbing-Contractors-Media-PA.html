<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on highly technical competence and specialized devices to identify the location of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and identify the place of those leaks at which noticeable water may or may not have emerged. Water temperature issues can be repaired by changing the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be brought on by a blocked aerator screen.
