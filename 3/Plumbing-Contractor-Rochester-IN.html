<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Rochester IN 46975</h3>

<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>Testing should be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor should have a legitimate, up-to-date plumbing license, current insurance, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently adjusted test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
