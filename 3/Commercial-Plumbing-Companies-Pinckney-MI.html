<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of remedy when it comes to drains.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
