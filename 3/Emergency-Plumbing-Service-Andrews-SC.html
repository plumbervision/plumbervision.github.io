<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While some of these problems can be credited to normal wear and tear or incorrect installation, in some cases your garbage disposal becomes damaged by products that shouldn't be gone through it.</p>
<p>Check to ensure it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to make certain it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you may need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the system beneath the sink.</p>
