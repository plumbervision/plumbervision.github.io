<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust certification requirements.

Damaged and rusted parts make repairs tough and costly, indicating a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>

Register at the Plumbing Inspections Section in person. A PVB must be installed 12 inches above the highest emission point.

It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
