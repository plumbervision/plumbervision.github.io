The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash.
