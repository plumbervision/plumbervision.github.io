<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our rigid trust accreditation requirements. An excellent guideline is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages.

If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
