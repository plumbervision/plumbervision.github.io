<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Marion KY</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
