<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Periodically honing the blades. To clean and sharpen the blades, all you need to do is grind a couple of ice cubes in the disposal before running cold water through the unit. 3.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports.

Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
