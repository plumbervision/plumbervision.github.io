<p>Examine the washer for wear or cracks when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are often offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are properly evaluated by certified workers.</p>
