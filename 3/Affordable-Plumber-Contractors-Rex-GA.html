<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In homes with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
