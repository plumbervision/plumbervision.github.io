As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
