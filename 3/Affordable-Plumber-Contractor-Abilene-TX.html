<p>While a DIY toilet replacement is definitely possible, it's also simple to mess up. And when you mess up a toilet installation, you can wind up with big problems: Leakages, messed up floorings, wetness in floor bases and walls-- serious and expensive concerns. Unless you're really experienced, it's best to trust a professional for replacing a toilet.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
