<p>Every affordable purchaser examines at least several things before making a deposit on a house. As you may be aware that the water quality here is pretty bad. But are you aware just how bad? The majority of the Valley in truth has a few of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all. In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is perfect for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond national health guidelines, and a even high portion of toxins in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity reasons "really difficult water".</p>
<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller specific service pipes, carrying water to private homes, apartment or condo companies, structures and stores.

Water enters the consumer facility through a water meter that tape-records circulation rates and water utilization for billing purposes. Private service pipelines are normally made from type, lead or plastic K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>

So we recommend repairing or installing water pressure regulators to protect your entire home.</p>
