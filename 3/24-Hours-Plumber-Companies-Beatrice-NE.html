<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Beatrice NE</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the support of a professional. Some minor blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet won't stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, particular issues do require a qualified plumber, and it is necessary to understand the distinction to prevent wasted cash, time, and disappointment.</p>
