The steps for changing a propane hot water heater are precisely the very same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are similar. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run.
