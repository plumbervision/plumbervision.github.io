<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Mount Rainier MD</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It's pretty common for particles to wind up being flushed down our drains. Consider how typically food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks. After sufficient time, these products may build up into obstructions, which can block the flow of water throughout a home.
