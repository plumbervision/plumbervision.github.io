<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions inspired water suppliers to carry out water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has become a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant clogs show your toilet no longer has the power needed to effectively remove waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Drains not draining extremely well? Its not simply you, drain cleaning is one of the most typical service calls we answer.
