<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical sufficient that many individuals go for diy repairs. But in some cases even identifying the leak can be an issue.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
