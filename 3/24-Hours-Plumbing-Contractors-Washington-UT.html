<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Washington UT 84780</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, similar to everyone we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and extremely educated. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either large or little job plumbing work.</p>
<p>2.) Something Fell Down the Drain: It doesn't matter if it's your kid's T-Rex toy or it's your wedding event ring; when particles falls under your kitchen sink, it can wind up causing all sorts of costly problems to your plumbing. A primary downside of copper pipes is that high pH, acidic water leads to rust in copper piping. If you are developing a brand-new house or do not presently have gas, there are numerous advantages to each type. Make the effort to comprehend the distinctions between gas and gas so that you can select the right one for your individual needs.</p>
