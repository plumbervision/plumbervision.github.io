<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Fairborn OH</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
