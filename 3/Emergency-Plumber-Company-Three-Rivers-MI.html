Well-kept pipes may last longer, and improperly preserved ones or those in areas with difficult water (suggesting it has high mineral content), may fail quicker, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the lifespan estimates.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last permanently. It has remained in place because your house was developed so it has to do with the same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
