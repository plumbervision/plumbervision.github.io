<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, examine for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

<p>It's a strangely intricate scientific process, but simple to treat. It uses salt to remove odors and minerals found in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium.

Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
