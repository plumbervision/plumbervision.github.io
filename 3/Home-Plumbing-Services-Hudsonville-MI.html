Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the entire component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
