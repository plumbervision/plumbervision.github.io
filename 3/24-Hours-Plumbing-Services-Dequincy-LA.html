For a plumber specializing in drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. The majority of problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the per hour rate.</p>

Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and after that every year.</p>
