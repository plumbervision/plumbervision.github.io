Due to the strengths of PVC, it is among the most widely used plastics in the world.</p>
<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad usage for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have actually become increasingly common, with a range of products and fittings used.</p>
