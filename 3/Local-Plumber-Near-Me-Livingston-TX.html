<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping).

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
