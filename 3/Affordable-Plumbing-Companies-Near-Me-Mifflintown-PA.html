<p>Why risk an insurance coverage claim on a flooded house when choosing a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is simply a simple call away. A malfunctioning toilet is one household issue most of us would rather prevent. Nevertheless, you can not neglect a toilet issue.

<p>Next, examine the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again crucial for the repair specialist to be familiar with the hardness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to decrease any scale development or corrosion. It is important that the repair technician is sensitive to the hardness and kind of the various coatings used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective finish.</p>
