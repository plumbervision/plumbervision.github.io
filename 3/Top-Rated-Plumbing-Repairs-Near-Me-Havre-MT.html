<h3>Septic System Installation in Havre Montana</h2>
<p>A professional inspection of your pipes is needed to determine if they need to be changed.

<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Havre MT</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
