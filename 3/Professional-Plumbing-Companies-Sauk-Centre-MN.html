<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
