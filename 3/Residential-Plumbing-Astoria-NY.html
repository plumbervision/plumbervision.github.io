<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Astoria NY</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leaks. If you do have regular leakages, we discover that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your home? Water pressure in the house resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be regulated to keep the system healthy. When uncontrolled water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is FAR MORE economical than mold remediation or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we suggest fixing or setting up water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>

<p>More than often, little leakages in our homes are quickly fixed through welding and we disregard it as a petty concern. However if the leak concerns are frequent and every once in a while some or the other corner of your home has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to examine the whole piping system to carry out house repiping. Multiple leaks shouldn't be ignored at all; else it may result in complex flooding concern soon.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
