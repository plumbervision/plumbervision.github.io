<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
