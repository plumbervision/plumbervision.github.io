<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

Suggestion: Location a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the inside. In many cases, repiping is your only viable alternative.</p>
