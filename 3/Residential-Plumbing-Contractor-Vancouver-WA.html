<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger tough water stick to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the salt ions.</p>
