Characteristics with water wells: Residence on well water must have an RP backflow preventer on their service line separating the general public water supply from the property. The RP for a residential or commercial property with a water well need to be evaluated upon installation and after that every year.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent.

<p>This is another combination that can work on sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can repeat this procedure.

<p>If there is a leak, we will find the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not currently been completed. Then, our professional will dig to find the gas line and leak.

<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
