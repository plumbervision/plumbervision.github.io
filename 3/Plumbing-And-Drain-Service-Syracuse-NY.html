<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage problems. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on debris. Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and table salt in the garbage disposal to eliminate grease. Another good technique is using a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
