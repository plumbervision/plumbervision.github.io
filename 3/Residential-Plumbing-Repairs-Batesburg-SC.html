<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
