<p>These are all indications that your unit should be examined by a plumber. We don't recommend attempting to repair this particular home appliance on your own, due to the fact that it does present a security threat, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to chop and grind waste. Since these chemicals will only harm the home appliance even more, you must likewise avoid using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal.</p>
