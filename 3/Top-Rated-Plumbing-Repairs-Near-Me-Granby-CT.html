<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Granby CT</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
