<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that might need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on homes change that might require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your organisation, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your business entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a small office the issues triggered by even small drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>

From washing your face, brushing your teeth, and bathing, to doing kitchen tasks like washing dishes, hot water is a need. If you own a commercial home or service, it can cause a substantial interruption in your organisation operations if your water heating equipment quits working.</p>
