<p>A recently set up hot water heater need to not produce strange noises, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things worsen considerably for homes with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
