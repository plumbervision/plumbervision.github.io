<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by securing your water-using devices from bad efficiency and premature failure. Some difficult water problems are very visible, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater components and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or unnoticeable, these problems have real costs connected with them. Clogged components cause replacement or reconditioning costs and can frustrate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs.
