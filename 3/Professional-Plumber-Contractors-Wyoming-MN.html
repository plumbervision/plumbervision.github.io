<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. If a repipe in Brenham is right for you, call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing checked and we will let you know.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
