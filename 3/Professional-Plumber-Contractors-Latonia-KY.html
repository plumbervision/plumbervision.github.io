<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters need to be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Pointer: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the inside. In many cases, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
