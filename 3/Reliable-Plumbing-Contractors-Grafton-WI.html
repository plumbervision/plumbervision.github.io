<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, typically referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the different jurisdictions within the State; lower the building's energy and water usage; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be carried out by a professional plumber if you want it to work well for many years to come. It is a reasonably simple device that draws food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that turns at high speeds, which pulverizes the scraps. They pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of when they are small enough. It typically takes up your kitchen sink drain however can be installed on simply one side if you have a duel drain setup.</p>
<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing.

You may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>

When this happens, house owners and plumbers should have the ability to clear out their drainage pipes. Structures without adequate cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at risk of a pipe rupturing.</p>
