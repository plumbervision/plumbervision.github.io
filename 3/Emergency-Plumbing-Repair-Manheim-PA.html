<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
