<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
