<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in San Marcos TX 78666</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
