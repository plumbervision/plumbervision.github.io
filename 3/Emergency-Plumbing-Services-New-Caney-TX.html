<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
