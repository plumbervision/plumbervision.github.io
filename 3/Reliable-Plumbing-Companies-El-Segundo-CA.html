<p>This article aims to attend to the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a correctly configured water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a couple of confusing truths that often lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal?

<h3>Water Heater Repair Services at El Segundo CA 90245</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
