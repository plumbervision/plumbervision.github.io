<p>If you discover an odor or undesirable odor originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, think about purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can get away. These flanges are simple and widely available to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the water system to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing throughout the installation process, shut off the water supply to your home. Ensure your water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electricity going to the unit.</p>
