I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
