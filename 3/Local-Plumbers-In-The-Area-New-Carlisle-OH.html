<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Reminder: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and couldn't be happier with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely experienced, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely recommend them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
