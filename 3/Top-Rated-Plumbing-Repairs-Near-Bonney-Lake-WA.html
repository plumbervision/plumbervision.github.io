We are now ready to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the parts to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the right place. It is also important that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or accidentally placed in the body. The parts must be placed so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>

Garbage disposals can be harmed if non-food items like flatware, sponges, or straws end up in the device. Waste disposal unit blockages can be caused by food items like fats or grease, bones, or extremely fibrous foods like celery.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, without any signs of leakage, you can most likely leave it in location. Chances are great that the mounting brackets on the brand-new unit will fit just great. To learn, eliminate the old disposal and install the new flange on it. You can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange if it fits.</p>
