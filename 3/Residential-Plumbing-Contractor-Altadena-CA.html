<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

When installing a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>
