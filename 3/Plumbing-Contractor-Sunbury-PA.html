<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground seamless gutter drains end in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your yard.

<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in.
