<p>Any device that utilizes water, from small coffee pots to large fridges, works more effectively in a home with softened water.

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection in between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
