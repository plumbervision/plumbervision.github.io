<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
