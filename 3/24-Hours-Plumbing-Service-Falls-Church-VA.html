<p>Once a big enough source of water has been recognized and evaluated, the third significant component of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>
