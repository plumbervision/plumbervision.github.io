<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Barnhart MO</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
