<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
