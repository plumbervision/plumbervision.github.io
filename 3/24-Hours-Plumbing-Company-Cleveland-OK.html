<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Pointer: Location a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the inside. In many cases, repiping is your only practical option.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
