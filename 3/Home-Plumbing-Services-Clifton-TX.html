<p>A freshly installed hot water heater ought to not produce weird noises, but it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things worsen significantly for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
