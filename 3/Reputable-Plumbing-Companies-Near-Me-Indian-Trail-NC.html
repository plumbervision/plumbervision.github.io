<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Indian Trail NC</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>In cold climates, soil, water or waste pipes must not be set up outside of a house, in outside walls, in attics, or crawlspaces, or in another other place subjected to freezing temperature unless some provisions are made to safeguard it from freezing by insulation or heat.
