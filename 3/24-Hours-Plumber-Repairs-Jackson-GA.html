<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be provided.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may need a little various steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll locate one of the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
