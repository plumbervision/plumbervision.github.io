<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
