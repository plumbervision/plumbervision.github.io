<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They must be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
