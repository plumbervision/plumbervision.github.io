When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "regular," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for contaminated water going into the safe and clean water circulation system.</p>
<p>Low water pressure in your faucets. Water which sputters and sprinkles out of faucets can be a sign that some part of your faucet is worn or has actually been set up improperly. Occasionally, low water pressure is also associated with more severe problems with pipes that need to be attended to before they worsen.

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
