<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the public water system from toxins and contaminants that could, under specific circumstances, be drawn into the public supply of water from private properties. If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost mainly depends upon the toilet you pick. Toilets vary in design, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more pricey than others. When installing a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or temporary connection in between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
