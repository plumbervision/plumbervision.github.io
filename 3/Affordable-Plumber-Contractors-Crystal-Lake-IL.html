<p>When a big sufficient source of water has been recognized and assessed, the 3rd significant part of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Many large cities need several aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>
