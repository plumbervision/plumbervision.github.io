<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
