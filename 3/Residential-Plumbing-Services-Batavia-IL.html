<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
