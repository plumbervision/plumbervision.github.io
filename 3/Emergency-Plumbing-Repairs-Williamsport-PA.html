You might have a leak someplace if you've been seeing a moldy odor establishing in the cabinets under the sink. It could be the drainpipe, the faucet, and even the supply hose. Since they are relatively easy to determine, switch on the water and get sleuthing under your sink.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate scientific procedure, but easy to remedy. It uses salt to get rid of minerals and odors found in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that connect and attract salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
