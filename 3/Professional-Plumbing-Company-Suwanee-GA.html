At that time, individuals had no concept that the lead in the pipes could seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health threats connected with lead.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will lead to decapitation, it may scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
