To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.)

<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some homes were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Usually, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
