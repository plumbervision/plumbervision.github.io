<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
