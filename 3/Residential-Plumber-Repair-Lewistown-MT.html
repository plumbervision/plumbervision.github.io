<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dosage, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if solidity had an effect on detergent savings. The study consisted of tests that removed hard soils, in addition to assessing spotting and filming.

When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>
