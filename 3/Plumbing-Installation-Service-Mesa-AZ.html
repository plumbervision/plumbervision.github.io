<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from rust and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house. This may not need completely repiping the house, considering that more recent materials may have already been used in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing.
