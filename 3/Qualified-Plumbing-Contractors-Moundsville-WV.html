<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Moundsville WV 26041!</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
