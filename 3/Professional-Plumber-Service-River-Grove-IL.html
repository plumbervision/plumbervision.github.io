<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating River Grove IL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
