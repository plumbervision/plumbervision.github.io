As of July 1, 1999, the DPH requires an RPD on all lines that lead to a fire lawn sprinkler with siamese connections, other than existing systems that currently have actually a DCVA set up (Ct.

<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
