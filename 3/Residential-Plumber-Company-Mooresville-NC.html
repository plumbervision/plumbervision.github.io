<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Mooresville NC</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service may look like a waste of cash. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be an economical solution, the severe components rust your inner drain pipe, with time, developing weak spots in the pipe that are likely to burst. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Observing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house resembles high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is FAR MORE economical than mold remediation or replacing flooring or drywall! So we recommend setting up or repairing water pressure regulators to secure your entire home.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Mooresville NC 28117</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
