<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
