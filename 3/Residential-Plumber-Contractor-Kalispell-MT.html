<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Usually, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water till it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently removed by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes tough water.</p>
