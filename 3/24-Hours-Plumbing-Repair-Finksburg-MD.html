<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Finksburg MD 21048</h3>

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
