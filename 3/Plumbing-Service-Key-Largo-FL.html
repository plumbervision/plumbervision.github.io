<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Contractor in Key Largo</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your home. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up.
