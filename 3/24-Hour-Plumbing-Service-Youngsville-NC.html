<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Youngsville NC 27596</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>

<p>Get rid of all parts of the disposer kit from package, and organize the contents. Remove the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly thoroughly from the sink (Images 1 and 2).
