<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the expansion occurring when boiling the water causes the tank to break and start leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
