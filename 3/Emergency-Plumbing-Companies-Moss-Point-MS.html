<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Moss Point MS</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
