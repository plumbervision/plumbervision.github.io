<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Typically, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>We offer in advance rates and accept all forms of payment. We have plumbing installation financing readily available to cover those unexpected water heating repairs or purchases or to avoid your having to wait to acquire necessary plumbing components.
