A lot of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Normally, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
