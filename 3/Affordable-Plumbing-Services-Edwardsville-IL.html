<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should likewise be provided.</p>
