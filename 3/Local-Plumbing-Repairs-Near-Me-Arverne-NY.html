<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
