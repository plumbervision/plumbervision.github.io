<p>It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage should likewise be provided.</p>
