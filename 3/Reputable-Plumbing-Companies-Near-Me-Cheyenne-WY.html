<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>If your problem is more associated to scale and mineral accumulation, it's important to be aware that most scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is brought on by difficult water.
