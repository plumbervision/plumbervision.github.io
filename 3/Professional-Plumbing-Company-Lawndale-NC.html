The cost of having pipes fixed or changed can differ considerably depending on the location of the pipes, the real issue, and the question of repairing or replacing; but typically, the cost to replace pipes is $80-$ 440 per hour or a repaired price of about $222.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
