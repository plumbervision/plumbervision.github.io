Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load.
