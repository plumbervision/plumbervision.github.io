<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
