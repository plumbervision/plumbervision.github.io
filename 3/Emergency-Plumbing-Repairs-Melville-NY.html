<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as outlined listed below. Both will create a great seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of preference.
