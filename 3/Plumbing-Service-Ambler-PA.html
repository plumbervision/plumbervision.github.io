This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Stegle states that when they are working with a customer on a custom-made house, they will work directly with the property owner when it comes to selecting faucets and other components.
