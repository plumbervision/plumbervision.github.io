<p>Leaks are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
