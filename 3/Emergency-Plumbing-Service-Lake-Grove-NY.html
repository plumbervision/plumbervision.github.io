<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Such possible health dangers are worrying, however they aren't the only problem. Backflow can also be exceptionally expensive to remediate. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mentions that the average backflow event takes nearly 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever wondered just what is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were produced to fight a surprisingly typical issue: difficult water.</p>
<p>Market prices for house water softeners may range from around $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and kind of softener. Softeners are ranked by the overall number of grains the unit can get rid of prior to being recharged. The cost of salt is around $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of salt chloride (NaCl), depending on the form bought, and approximately $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>

Disconnect the disposal from the flange assembly and eliminate it from the drain. Bought the Insinkerator from Lowes for $199 + $15 tax. Installation by a plumber cost $275, but he also needed to replace rusty inlet water pipes. About 1.5 hours total.</p>
