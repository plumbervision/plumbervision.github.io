<p>Physical damage: If you discover any physical damage to the system, it may be time for a professional water heater replacement.

<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Chandler OK 74834</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
