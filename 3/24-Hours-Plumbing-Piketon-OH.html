<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Piketon OH 45661? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
