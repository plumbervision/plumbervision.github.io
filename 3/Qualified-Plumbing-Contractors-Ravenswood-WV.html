<p>More than typically, small leakages in our houses are easily fixed through welding and we overlook it as a petty problem. But if the leakage issues are frequent and every once in a while some or the other corner of your home has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to check the whole piping system to carry out house repiping. Multiple leaks should not be ignored at all; else it might result in complicated flooding issue soon.</p>
