<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are checked for correct grading to preserve down circulation. The plumbing system is tested for leakages. We inspect that the product utilized in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing laboratory.

We also check the vent pipes to balance the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
