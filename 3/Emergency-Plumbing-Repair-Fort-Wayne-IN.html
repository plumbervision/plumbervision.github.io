<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the extent of the rot.

Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
