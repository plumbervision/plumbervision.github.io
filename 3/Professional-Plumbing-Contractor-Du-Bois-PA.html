<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
