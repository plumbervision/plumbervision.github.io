<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, appropriately set up and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage.
