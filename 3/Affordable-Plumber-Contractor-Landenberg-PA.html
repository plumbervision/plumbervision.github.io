<p>Leaks are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
