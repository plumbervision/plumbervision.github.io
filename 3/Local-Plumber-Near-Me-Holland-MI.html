Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
