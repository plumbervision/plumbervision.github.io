<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling. Often it may be required to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to maker directions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
