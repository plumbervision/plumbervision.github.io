<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
