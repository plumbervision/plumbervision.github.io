<p>More than often, small leaks in our homes are quickly fixed through welding and we overlook it as a petty problem.

<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
