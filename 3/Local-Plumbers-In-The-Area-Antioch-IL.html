<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
