<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you've found the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
