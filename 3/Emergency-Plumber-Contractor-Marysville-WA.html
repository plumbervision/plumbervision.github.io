<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be removed. Backflow assemblies are needed to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and healthcare facilities, in addition to industrial centers.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
