<p>This style water heater may make the most sense for you if you have a large bathtub or more that 2 bathrooms. There are some installation factors to consider, especially around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, however with the capability for a 50-gallon tank to create more warm water than a standard 80-gallon tank, these things are pretty special.
