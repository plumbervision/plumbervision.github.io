<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Philadelphia PA</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
