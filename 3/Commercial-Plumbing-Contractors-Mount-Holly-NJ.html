Due to the fact that the source of leaking water can be tough to detect, our plumbers typically perform a dye test to determine the source. Frequently, pipes or water service lines are changed, just to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not always dirty or stained and frequently gets incorrect for a water supply line leak.</p>
