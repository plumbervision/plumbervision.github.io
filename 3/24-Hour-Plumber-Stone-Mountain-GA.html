<p>For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical service, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
