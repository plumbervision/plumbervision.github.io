When washing items are utilized in difficult water - tough water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. Any location where water is consisted of is prone to clogged drains.

When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin.
