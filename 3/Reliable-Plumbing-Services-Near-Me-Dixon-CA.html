<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
