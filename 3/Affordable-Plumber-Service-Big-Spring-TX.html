<p>Commercial sink plumbing is more complex than residential bathroom or kitchen sink plumbing. Commercial sinks deal with more water and have a more effective straining system to keep food and other particles out of the plumbing system. In reality, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. If your commercial sinks have a clogged drain, call the professionals at Roto-Rooter. We offer a full series of commercial drain services to help you keep your facility running efficiently. We provide sink repair, toilet repair, shower repair and can even fix floor drains.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience obstructions in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in multiple areas and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Eliminate all parts of the disposer package from package, and organize the contents. Remove the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly thoroughly from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Place a large pan below the sink to capture water that might spill when you disconnect the drain, and keep a towel close by to tidy up spills.
