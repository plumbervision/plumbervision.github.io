<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Installing gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger difficult water stick to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
