<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Orchard Park NY</h3>

When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk.
