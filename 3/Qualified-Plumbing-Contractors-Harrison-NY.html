While seemingly a deal, a hot water heater rated for just 7 years is typically most likely to stop working prior to you recover your financial investment.

<p>Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area. The California Department of Health Services needs each of these assemblies to be evaluated each year. This testing is done by backflow assembly testers authorized by the Orange County Healthcare Company. A list of the certified testers is readily available online. To consult with an IRWD cross-connection and backflow prevention specialist, please call 949-453-5761.</p>
