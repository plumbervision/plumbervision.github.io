<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.
