<h3>Washer Bibs Replacement in Sound Beach New York</h2>

<p>Double Examine Valve - Model GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is basically a disrobed Check Valve without shut off valves and test dicks.

This piece of equipment is the center of controversy with lots of backflow authorities and should never be puzzled with Check Valves.
