<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Whitsett NC 27377</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
