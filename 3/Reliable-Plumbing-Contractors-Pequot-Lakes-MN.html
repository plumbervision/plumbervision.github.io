<p>Mixing evaporated salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening tank. It is recommended that you permit your unit to go empty of one type of salt before including another to avoid the event of any problems.

And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
