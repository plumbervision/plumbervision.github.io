<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
