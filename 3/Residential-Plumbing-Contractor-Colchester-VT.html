<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The average time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour. The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look brown or rusty, and the water might have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your home starts to reveal any of these signs of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the entire plumbing system.</p>
