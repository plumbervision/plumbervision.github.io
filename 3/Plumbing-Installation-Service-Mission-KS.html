<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is fairly short. Crisp or soft foods are fine, however hard or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching twist-ties and pads. While some older homes may not have backflow preventers, all newer properties are needed to have them. Doug's can help you find and identify them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are utilized in your house or service. We can likewise perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers.
