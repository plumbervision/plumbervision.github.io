<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe.
