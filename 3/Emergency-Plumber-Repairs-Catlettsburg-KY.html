If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a prompt manner, the opportunities are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>As soon as a large sufficient source of water has been determined and assessed, the third significant part of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
