<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to utilize Bio-Clean items for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is a natural option that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at getting rid of gunk, waste, and natural material that so typically clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partially fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for organic product and eat away at it, producing harmless by-products of carbon water, mineral, and dioxide ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
