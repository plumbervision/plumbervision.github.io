Nasty odor: A strong, unpleasant smell coming from your drains could suggest one of 2 problems: food congesting the drain, or a bigger problem in your sewage line.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
