<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
