<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must likewise be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to split and solidify or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak.
