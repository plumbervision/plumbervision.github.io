<p>Backflow preventers are likewise required by the plumbing code. Except within Shoreline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County).

<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization North Hills CA</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>This may sound like a joke, but it's really serious if you want to truly get the most out of your financial investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist.

Failing an examination can mean unpleasant hold-ups in your task.</p>
