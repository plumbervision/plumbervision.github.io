<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. The majority of kitchen sink obstructions are due to heavy grease accumulation and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the garbage and utilize the disposal for the little particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can depend on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and take pleasure in much better water for bathing and appliances.</p>
<p>Toilet repair tends to freak most people out a little, which is totally reasonable. No one wants to inadvertently break something that might flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, most of toilet repairs are simple and simple tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes. The most common question we run into concerning toilet repair is how to find the best parts for your toilet. In some cases this is simple, and sometimes it's not. Mainly it's simple though.</p>

<p>A few of the reasons for drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
