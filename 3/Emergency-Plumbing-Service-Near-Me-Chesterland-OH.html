<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of security.

There are two various kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them only since they will be on an accreditation test.</p>
