The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health hazard conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
