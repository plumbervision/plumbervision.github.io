<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Central Square NY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
