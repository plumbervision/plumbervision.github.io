<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any scenario that may need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on homes change that might need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your company, they can trigger monetary losses and in some instances can stop your organisation totally. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a small office the issues brought on by even little drain problems can cause major problems.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
