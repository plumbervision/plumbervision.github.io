<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
