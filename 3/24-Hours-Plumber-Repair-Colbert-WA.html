<p>Mixing evaporated salt with rock salt is not advised, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is advised that you allow your unit to go empty of one type of salt before including another to avoid the incident of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a permit.

<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Colbert WA</h3>
<p>There are lots of elements to a toilet that interact to make it work. There could be a problem with the handle or the lift arm if it is not flushing appropriately. It might also be the flush lever or the flapper. An experienced professional would have the ability to identify which part is failing to make the toilet repair immediately. Is your hot water heater giving cold instead of warm water? Yikes! It may be something as easy as a blown pilot burner or as made complex as a defective thermocouple. Relighting the pilot light might be a Do It Yourself project. Repairing or changing the thermocouple is a job for our group of proficient pros.</p>
