<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In houses with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
