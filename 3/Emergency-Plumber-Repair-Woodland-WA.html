<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Woodland</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

In many cases, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
