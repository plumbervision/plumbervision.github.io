However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
