It could be in need of significant repairs or it might be nearing the end of its lifespan if your disposal is often making sounds that are irregular for the machine. Frequent blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might indicate an issue with the disposal. It is probably due to too much usage over a long duration of time if there are leaks coming from your system. Much of these leaks can be repaired, but if they end up being bigger and more regular, you should consider total system replacement.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.
