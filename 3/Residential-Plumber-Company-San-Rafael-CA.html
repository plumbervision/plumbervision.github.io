<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in.

<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as outlined below.

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
