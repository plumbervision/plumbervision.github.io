<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
