Throughout regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads.

<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and significant leakages. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-term service.</p>
