<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>From below the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
