<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your yard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Regular professional maintenance is key to preventing water heater problems. Your hot water heater must be checked by a professional at least as soon as a year.
